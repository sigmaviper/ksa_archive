noy tae: shuts down/runs away from the situation bc he hates conflict



iylm jk: tries to communicate that he's angry but if he gets spoken over he internalizes it and won't explain why he's angry later until he's calmed down

iylm tae: this is our resident brat he's throwing the teensiest bit of a tantrum and gets even more angry if told to calm down



skillshare jk: when he's mad he gets even more angry if he has to explain why he's mad. definitely locking himself in a room

skillshare tae: he's a yeller



dna jk: he's a stonewaller he doesn't even speak he's too angry

dna tae: actually explains his point very calmly and rationally but then refused to hear the other side until he's finished



losin end jk: I remember saying he genuinely doesn't really get angry

losin end tae: makes passive aggressive comments until jk asks him to come out and say what he means

6937,anyone else has been RUINED by the fact that tae wanted to get better because he saw jungkook looking better/more at peace and jk was more at peace because he saw tae getting better like their lives were shaped by their love reflected back to each other even while they were apart they’d have reasons to believe in soulmates if they weren’t so science minded bc how do you explain how much they’re each other’s destiny and their love for the other shaped their lives im so i need a minute,I WASN'T...but now I certainly am...,"30 May, 2024",set(),1354912774,
6936,do they give eo tips on how to deal with it and if so which (assuming dna tae deals with it hdkfj),"honestly I feel like dna tae doesn't do much heavy lifting on that front bc he's got enough of his own problems to deal with. he's said his piece enough times already and at this point his jk is the only one who can do the final steps of self-forgiveness. I feel like Jin is more instrumental there as well esp since a huge chunk of jk's guilt involves what happened to namjoon. meanwhile le jk is the one to step in and help tae work through his guilt bc literally NO ONE has even attempted before or told tae that hey actually you should be nicer to yourself. and I think too le tae has more reason to feel guilty because he did do a horrible thing, and dna jk so much of what he did that was 'wrong' is rooted in him wanting to do what's best for everyone else.



I feel if anything le jk would actually encourage dna tae to stay out of it/not put the burden on himself for his jk to change his thinking because it's a similar lesson le jk had to learn and only understood bc he went through it himself and because he wanted to. dna tae could tell his jk every day but at the end of the day only dna jk can make that final step","30 May, 2024","{'dna', 'le'}",1354906777,

6932,what's something that *extremely and completely hypothetically* would make your tks call it quits?,"what an AWFUL scenario to think about but ok here we go:



cy: literally the ONLY reason I could think of them ending things is if one of their children DIED and tae would retreat too far into himself and need to have space to grieve. which of course jk gives him bc he'd cut off an arm for tae but I think they'd then be that divorced couple where jk is over all the time making sure he's getting good meals and enough sleep etc. eventually tae would find his way back to jk



noy: jk (nobly, foolishly, misguidedly) would end it if his mental health was in a really bad spot again. to which I think tae would do everything in his power to get back together again even if it's like sending literal postcards to jk's dad's house or something



iylm: just from not having enough time to spend together between their respective careers and traveling



skillshare: if they got to a point of wanting different things for their lives (like tae wanting to pursue his career vs. jk wanting to move to the countryside or something)



dna: tae would put a stop to things for a while if he started to feel neglected compared to jk's spiderman duties. would still be there to patch him up and would be SLIGHTLY awkward at work but he'd pull away from how close they were before



losin end: honestly I feel like they just wouldn't. like even if they weren't madly in love anymore they would still just hang out all the time and live together and have sex because they're too far into their lives to bother venturing out again. and they still like each other and get along so...no point in rocking the boat even if they aren't 'together' officially anymore

Sooooo... was i wrong in my interpretation or did you mean more himself as in more vulnerable, even more honest ?","no I think you're right in what you said, it's more his true personality shining through the longer he felt comfortable with jk. though the cunty dgaf traits are still a part of him, there's a much softer side of him he lets jk see, and he becomes more and more straightforward as they grow together (minus his big secret, of course) which helps jk get to the heart of him very quickly. I think tae is used to people obscuring what they mean and playing games, and while part of him loves to play games too the other half of him just wants to relax and say what he means. so when jk is more open both with his affection and his words and his life, tae is inspired to lean away from the act he so often puts on","28 May, 2024",{'le'},1354511188,

in between all the missing, i came up with a question about the chapter 11&12 : you know how jk kept referring to kai like an unblemished/unscarred version of himself - and they had the whole discussion about how tae approached him bc he looked like kai but then loved him for him bc le jk is just the best person to person. while the whole kai replacement question has been dealt with, i just felt so sad reading about how jk sees himself as ugly in a way bc of his scars. and how this was the first and loudest difference he noticed between himself and kai as well... does he ever say something about this to tae ? maybe not the kai comparison, but maybe flippantly refer to himself as ugly/marred/fucked up ? how would tae react ?

i need jk to be cherished always !!!","Oh this is a good question! I guess him seeing himself as “ugly” in a way is less like he’s “deformed” or physically unattractive, I think he in his selfless Jungkook way is more considered with inflicted that damage on others, like, exposing them to the violence he experienced and making them scared or uncomfortable (like him wanting to cover up when Hanna sees). Since they’re a part of him he can’t completely separate himself but I think if he were to say something it’d be like “my scars” rather than “me”.” I don’t know if he would unless it was a situation with outside people and he tried to apologize again for them. But with just him and Tae I think he gets that Tae doesn’t see them badly or think less of him for them, and if he ever said something Tae would shut it down in a second especially since it’s a permanent part of him.","27 May, 2024",{'le'},1354510630,

I'm curious about the writing process because I'm trying to tap back into creative writing after doing technical writing for many years, and I find it's challenging to get into that flow state with creative writing. I used to do it by extension, since I always read a lot, but now it seems as though my brain is stuck on technique. I wonder while I write, ""was that too much telling? Does this dialogue feel forced? Are we heading towards white room syndrome? Are these emotions too subtle? Will the reader get the point I'm implying?""



I really enjoy your writing style, so any insight is welcome!","definitely the latter. I honestly don't know a lot about technical writing beyond like the 5 paragraph essay or things that pertain purely to academic writing. I actually avoid most rules/techniques for creative writing bc I don't want to be in that  mindset of second-guessing what I write. I think if I was to actually pursue creative writing in a professional way I'd potentially explore more of that, but since fanfic is free and my hobby I like to just do what I want. advice to you is probably annoying and obvious but I would just /write/. like set a timer and challenge yourself to not look back over anything you've written until the time runs out. it's easier to get into a flow and write a chunk of words, and then you can analyze afterwards when you edit. though sometimes I don't reread my stuff until after I post it LOL, that helps with it being more intuitive too. with fanfic in particular there's no standard it has to meet, so I just write what feels enjoyable for me to write and what I would want to read","24 May, 2024",{'noy'},1354384802,

what's funny about his attraction to tae is that it's like BARELY sexual. obviously he has eyeballs so he can see that tae is hot but as we can see with daeshim even though he looks like a sack of melted butter now jk is still attracted to him bc of their shared history and how well daeshim knows him. which is why I think when it comes to his feelings for tae he's not quite sure what it is beyond something like friendship or companionship, or maybe like a need to be around someone that cares for him even if it's only bc he's paid to.



that's the primary difference between tae and daeshim too, like jk has that mental roadblock of 'hyung cares bc he's paid to' vs. daeshim is 'he cares because he cares' (though he does recognize how dae used him, but it's still hard for him to shake his feelings). I also think if he hadn't just found out about hyunjin he'd probably be less shaken by daeshim coming back. but for 3 years he's thought taehyung was his/he was the only person getting tae's devoted attention (paid or not) and now that he finds out tae has a kid it's given him this other bizarre feeling that makes him want to fistfight a child.","21 May, 2024",{'chingu'},1354255953,

6722,I just finished reading IYLM and I have to say it is a masterpiece! wonderful story and characters 🥹 I’m so obsessed with Namjoon and Taehyung relationship 🥹 and it came to my mind while reading that TaeJoon are very attached but we only saw how Joon is always worried and assume the worst. Did Taehyung ever felt scared or worried for Joon? If he didn’t answer the phone or if got sick?,"great question!! a lot of Tae's worries are more on the mental/psychological side for Joon, like at one point he mentions he's not sure if Joon would go on with life if Tae died, and he is really observant about how Joon grieves and what he needs to feel comforted. from Tae a lot of it is Tae taking care of himself/letting Joon take care of him, so I think part of Tae other than genuinely wanting/needing that coddling lets Joon do it bc he knows it helps Joon too. in terms of Joon's physical health/safety I honestly don't think it crosses Tae's mind too often. but he's much more emotionally intelligent so he worries over Joon's emotional health (like him problem-solving about the rings, telling Joon they're being co-dependent, being the one to intentionally break away) and focuses his energy on that","21 May, 2024",{'iylm'},1354123901,

i think he's such an underrated character in cy, he's specially standing out in my current reread mainly in those first chapters when jungkook starts hanging out with everyone and it's so nice to see how comfortable jungkook feels around him (with him not forcing him to do anything he isn't feeling and not seeing him just as jin's little brother) and im pretty sure it's all a mix of joon just being a chill? friend but also a conscious effort to welcome jungkook into the group and help him feel at ease with them and i think that's very sweet","he so is! I feel like he gets overshadowed by the jinkook dynamic and the vmin dynamic but he's a great friend! yes he's chill and I feel like as a childless single person myself I relate to him hard. excited for his pov and will probably want to do another joon-centric chapter that focuses on his relationship with each of them, I just need to think of a good plot","21 May, 2024",{'cy'},1354253757,
6718,"Heyyyy i have yet another le question but this time about yugyeom : i was wondering when he wrote that letter to jungkook... was it very close to when he died or way before ? bc at first it was implied that he committed suicide but then we found out it was jk who killed him... but like the whole ""i wanted it to be you"" thing... did yugyeom go into everything guessing (and maybe even hoping) for that ending ? could you please elaborate on the timing of all this ? my guess is yugyeom's dad started pressuring him and yugyeom knew he'd have to make a choice between his dad and jk in a way ? and bc he was desperate for his dad's acceptance the way tae was in a way, he did as his dad asked but emotionally still was loyal to jk in the sense that he knew it wouldn't work and prepared his will and everything in advance ???","I imagined it as like the week/a few days before. it's more vague in the fic but I think he genuinely starts to lose it mentally from all the pressure he's under + the heavy drug use that enters his life again, and I think he writes the letter in a moment of clarity. I like to imagine he started putting money aside for Jungkook the second he found out Jungkook was spider-man and he ramped that up when he started working with his father and felt himself go into a spiral. I agree with what you said about him being emotionally loyal to jk like deep down jk is his best friend and the one he loves not his dad, so when some part of him recognizes the path he's going down isn't one that can be stopped he does what he can to make sure jk will be taken care of when he's gone. I think he knows pretty clearly when he's writing the letter that he'll die soon one way or another. so then when jk is the one to show up to stop him once he gets stabbed as he's dying that clarity comes back for a final time and he knows this was the only way it could end. 



I guess he wanted it to work to get his father's approval but he knew that if it didn't he wouldn't be making it out, and he was grateful it was jk with him at the end over anyone else, bc then he got to apologize","21 May, 2024",{'le'},1354012905,

I mean, I'm not up to date with my superhero lore so my data is all gathered from ksa fics😂 It could be possible, I guess, according to DNA jk you can just do superhero stuff when the sun goes down.","hmmm I mean for le jk I think it's less like he didn't have a career and more that he took odd jobs to be flexible/if he lost that job bc of a save than it'd be easy to get work doing something else. but yeah to be a hero is to be on call pretty much all the time which he certainly was as we could see with the police alerts to his phone



for dna it's a little different, I think he has a better grasp of what he can and can't do and still maintain his secret identity. le jk didn't have to worry about that after yugyeom so he had way more flexibility to be perceived however even if it meant running out midshift on a job or something. for dna jk I think he understands he can only go so far with it all before it comes undone. with how much Jin cares about him and is involved in his life it's too hard for him to just make superhero his full job (also he has to make money to survive LOL). I think when he gets the job at ditko to make Jin less worried he probably has a discussion with himself about the job being a non-negotiable of something he can't bail on. so of course now he sleeps like 20 minutes a night and it's not good for him at all, but more than le he has a reason to keep pretending to lead a normal life","21 May, 2024","{'dna', 'le'}",1354002674,

how are their memories? we know some canonically, but who’s the one who’s always getting in trouble for remembering incidents with the wrong people and who is listening to the same story 6 times coz they just don’t remember?","cy jk: prides himself on having a good memory but I feel like every so often he makes a horrific blunder like spills the tea to someone that tea is actually about and didn't realize LOL

cy tae: he's not great on the broad strokes of someone's life but he'll remember little details like 'oh how's your sister's dog?' or 'I got this for you bc I remember you mentioned reading something similar a few years ago and liking it.' and yet he can't remember their name 💀 also as he gets older he 100% is the 'dad you've already told me this' it happens soooo often when he's a grandfather I feel but  most of the time they just let him do it



noy jk: has a better memory than he thinks, but doesn't fully realize it bc he pushes so many of his traumatic memories down it kinda tramples the others too

noy tae: a lot of his memory is associated with songs. I think he'll hear a song and remember very clearly a time in his life either when it was on repeat or he heard it for the first time, etc. also a detail noticer



iylm jk: steel trap this is our book quote boy after all. remembers so much about other people it always surprises them, I think they discount him a lot bc he's quiet. I think it unnerves some of his university friends at first but they realize he's just trying to relate and make friends with them

iylm tae: steel tube it all just slides right out. not his fault at all though poor baby. 100% guilty of misremembering different stories with different people but everyone gives him a pass like he deserves



skillshare jk: chronic story relistener, he can't remember if he's heard it before or not

skillshare tae: chronic story reteller



dna jk: I would say pretty normal overall, he has a memory in particular for left brain stuff

dna tae: idk how to explain it but if it's brain knowledge (like science, math, learning stuff, etc.) he's got a fantastic memory, but if it's mind knowledge (birthdays, names, movies he's seen, etc.) it's hard for him to recall



losin end jk: I think his memory is kinda shot ngl. it's less bc he's bad at remembering things and more like his life was so much of the same day in and day out for so long it all started to blend together. he could probably remember a particularly important save but he might not fully remember when it was or if he's misremembering it as someone else

losin end tae: unfortunately has a very clear memory and he kinda wishes he didn't a lot of the time



chingu jk: what is memory when it comes to dates and faces and names. that's what hyung is for. he uses his memory for important things like his favorite k-drama lines and the full lore of The Demon Prince Ate My Lunch and Now We're Married!!

cy tae: any luxury clothes that aren't vintage or secondhand. he's very suspicious of their quality esp if he's only seeing it online. the problem is usually that he sees a piece he falls in love with and can't stop thinking about but won't actually buy it until he can confirm it's 100% amazing quality



noy jk: a new console, he tries to figure out which will give him access to the best streaming library but also be compatible with the largest amount of his older games

noy tae: sonny angels 💀 he's had his eye on latte cat for quite a while



iylm jk: as a confirmed first edition collector he spends a long long time considering his purchases since they are in the hundreds of thousands of dollars range sometimes. 

iylm tae: as the confirmed bts stan he's an avid photocard collector. he tries to do mostly trades but he'll cave sometimes and hunt for ones people are selling to try and complete his sets



skillshare jk: a new drawing tablet

skillshare tae: I just know in my heart he makes the most frivolous purchases on a whim no problem but when it comes to replacing necessities he takes F O R E V E R like takes 3 months to get a new chairs for his kitchen after already giving away his old ones so they literally have to eat on the floor



dna jk: a high-quality sewing machine bc his is just about on its last legs

dna tae: a high-tech telescope that's supposed to help cut through light pollution to see the stars and planets better



losin end jk: new running sneakers. he's not used to having money to spend and he feels bad spending that much on a pair of shoes

losin end tae: plane tickets! he's been wanting to take a trip somewhere for forever but hasn't had someone to go with



chingu jk: he's very particular about his home so takes forever to make his mind about things like pillows, sheets, towels, etc. tae ends up getting it for him bc he knows what jk will like even if jk doesn't

chingu tae: when hwayoung needs a new therapist he spends a veryyyy long time researching, jk ends up unknowingly paying for it bc the higher hourly rate gets covered by tae getting a raise for seemingly no reason (jk's dad feels bad about tae having to explain 'serving cunt' and compensates him accordingly)","17 May, 2024","{'cy', 'noy', 'iylm', 'dna', 'headcanon', 'skillshare', 'chingu', 'le'}",1353930680,

cy tae: has to initiate or jk will be like a stick, I think as they get older it becomes more of a cute thing they do like if they're on an 'official' date jk will still wait for tae to take his hand first



noy jk: stage 5 clinger even though he swears he's not and he's wayyyy too touch for being out among the common folk

noy tae: the one that actually has common sense and doesn't want to get put on the sex offender registry for getting handsy in public. instead uses his words to get his point across and teases jk into oblivion bc he knows what'll come when they get home



iylm jk: the actual nervous stick he's not doing anything but being a statue

iylm tae: luckily for him casual contact runs in his veins so he makes it easy



skillshare jk: the one to initiate contact

skillshare tae: the one to cling afterwards



dna jk: clingier than he realizes, it's less like pda more like helping tae feel secure/grounded

dna tae: initiates the contact and sometimes he has less than pure intentions on his mind (as is his right)



losin end jk: he's getting better at initiating the contact but tae is still the primary on that

losin end tae: sooooo intimate and tender like stroking his hair, hand on his back to guide him in a direction, tilting his chin, like none of it is inappropriate but you still feel like you're intruding looking at them

cy tae: he takes longer actually getting to work, stops for a coffee and a pastry or something before going



noy jk: simply does not work LOL the benefits of being a freelancer. if he's up against a deadline he'll bake something for tae that takes a long time and challenges himself to get as much work done while it's in the oven as he can

noy tae: stalls as much as he can once he gets to practice he'll just try to talk and joke around with joon and hobi but most of the time hobi sees right through him



iylm jk: he'll work, he'll just be quiet and try to get everything done as fast as possible so it can be over

iylm tae: most of the time it is not up to him to get himself to work so he's forced there anyway. but if he doesn't want to work it's very very obvious, he's not shy about being kinda bratty



skillshare jk: takes a shower and brews a cup of coffee. somehow that always puts him in a working mindset and forces him to focus. it's harder since he just works from home and is his own boss, but usually he manages. he lets himself have one unplanned day off a month as a treat

skillshare tae: jk has sic bam on him to get him up, I feel like you can see the days he doesn't want to be there bc he'll be wearing his glasses and his hair will be extra frizzy



dna jk: skips 💀 (at least he did at the bugle, now he never wants to miss work bc tae's there 😊)

dna tae: DON'T WANT TO GO TO WORK? DON'T WANT TO DISCOVER? DON'T WANT TO CREATE? DON'T WANT TO LEARN?

I am terrified of the drill at the dentist and I have to get a root canal the day Jin gets back from the military (so there is some light at the end of the tunnel!)  I originally was going to get it on my birthday (this might be TMI but I couldn't get the root canal done that day because it turns out the cavity was INFECTED live laugh love, but they still had to go to down on my tooth and I am Suffering) so how would your characters--any that you'd like to answer this!!--react to getting a root canal on a special day, and how do they in general feel about the dentist?","cy jk: neutral about the dentist but HATED having braces so much he's paranoid he'll have to get adult braces if he doesn't wear his retainer so he still uses it every night until he's like well into his 50s

cy tae: he really hates going to the doctor so the dentist is actually kind of a nice reprieve



noy jk: jin is his dentist and he always gets roasted when he goes. though I feel like lowkey they bond bc after he starts on antidepressants he gets a bunch of cavities from the dry mouth it gives him and jin helps him manage it all

noy tae: poor baby does NOT like the dentist he knows it won't hurt necessarily but he hates the feeling of getting his teeth cleaned like all the scraping and suction



iylm jk: he is a dentist's dream he flosses daily has a tongue scraper uses a water pic never had a cavity strong enamel healthy gums I feel like he's in and out of there in 20 minutes

iylm tae: I feel like all his hygiene/maintenance appointments are under the same umbrella of his modeling agency so he knows  his dentist pretty well at this point and doesn't mind going. hates when he gets his teeth whitened though bc then he has to avoid certain foods for a few days to prevent stains



skillshare jk: something in me just feels that he has bad teeth like genetically. always gets cavities even though he does everything he should and had to get his wisdom teeth out. doesn't like the dentist just bc every time he goes he knows they'll find something else that has to be fixed

skillshare tae: tries to talk to the dentist mid-cleaning LOL he doesn't have any strong feeling about it but I feel like all the dental assistants LOVE him and are excited when his appointment comes around again



dna jk: jin bullies him into going at least once a year, it's not that he dislikes it he just never makes the time

dna tae: goes to a dentist he's friends with from college and gets to have a behind the scenes look at everything like the xray machine and stuff



losin end jk: thank god his spidey powers keep him in good health bc he hasn't been to the dentist since grade school

losin end tae: goes to one of those luxury dentist offices that serves cucumber water in the lobby or something



chingu jk: haaates the dentist for similar reasons to noy tae. the feel of it makes him squirm and he doesn't like peoples hands in his mouth unless he asks for it

cy tae: he used to be really bad like burned water bad but once they moved in together he started learning and by the time they have kids he's pretty good at it



noy jk: nearing chef-level abilities of course, Ari is a really good cook so he's picked up all her tips and tricks. I feel like at some point he gets a lot of lolly's recipes from tae's parents and starts making them too

noy tae: I said once the only thing he's good at making is pancakes and he only learned to perfect them bc he knows they're jk's favorite breakfast food



iylm jk: he can put together some basic stuff, similar to cy jk if he follows a recipe he'll do ok. ends up making the same thing a lot of the time because it's easy to remember and he knows what he has to get at the grocery store

iylm tae: thank god jk can somewhat cook because otherwise he'd starve 💀 this guy has never had to cook in his life, it's either been whoever he's staying with, whatever food's provided for him as part of his work package, or whatever he orders online from an app. who's cooking tae doesn't know her



skillshare jk: almost always makes korean food bc why would he not. british food is disgusting and he hates it

skillshare tae: another tae that but for his jk would not eat homemade food ever. I feel like he's used the stove in his apartment all of 2 times. 



dna jk: if he actually had the time or resources to learn he'd be pretty good. he can pull a few things out of his ass thanks to growing up with jin but a lot of the time he's surviving off bodega sandwiches and instant noodles

dna tae: canonically sucks at cooking. yoongi really keeps him alive fr. I feel like he's sneakily good at baking though bc as he says 'cooking is an art but baking is a science 🤓'



losin end jk: he's never had much of a chance for elaborate cooking, but I think he's surprisingly adept at making sauces/adding flavor to things

losin end tae: he's really good and his food tastes amazing bc he has the time and money for fresh ingredients. it's something he's picked up over the years and honed bc the alternative for cooking alone is eating out alone and it was too depressing to do that

6566,"ok so i have another argument in favor of tae learning jk was spiderman (even tho at the end of the day, they're your characters, it is your story, it is up to you, i will love the final chapter and this story no matter what your decision on this may be) and it's an argument in three points so pls be patient with me : 

1) i think that while spiderman may seem like a reason for jk's loneliness, it was also a sort of crutch for him to cope with that loneliness, almost like a friend (even tho it was himself but you know what i mean i hope) before he had tae and after yugyeom, he had spiderman to simultaneously lean on and suffer from. 

2) whether they're nice or horrible, things we live thru shape who we are. and in cases like tae, it can isolate you bc you're the only one who knows what you lived thru. Now, in jk's case, this applied more to yugyeom's death, but spiderman did shape him, and as a result, even if he is not spiderman now, spiderman is always gonna be a part of who he is in the now.

3) this may be very depressed barbie of me, but i think a lot about who and/or what is remembered after they're gone. there are so many people that no one will know have existed simply bc they were regular people and/or alone. even in flea stores, i look at all the stuff and wonder who they once belonged to, if it meant anything to the initial owner... all this to say, while i'm certain that jk will now have a family with tae and hopefully hanna later on, so he as a person will be remembered, the idea of his spidey suit ending up in a trashcan or as an old secondhand costume that is left to dust in the corner of a flea store makes me really sad. 

To sum up, jk is in a better place now as an individual, he is no longer lonely, no longer spiderman. That's all clear. But i guess, in a sense, someone he loves knowing (and appreciating, not treating him as a saint as the other anon said but like seeing how hard and lonely it must have been) that he was spiderman would make his past less lonely ? or make him less lonely in regard to his past ? idk if this made sense, maybe i'm just intensely projecting :')",hmmm these are valid points...I will take them into consideration...,"15 May, 2024",{'le'},1353582813,

6559,"i am actually a little confused here... trying to understand taehyung's work personality and motivations a little better. 



so does taehyung love working because he likes to just you know, create things, work on projects, put things out in the world? coz that's what he likes to do outside of work too. but he also likes... getting his way? he likes trying to manage things, i guess, yes? i kinda find it a bit hard to match that with the fact that he is very company-driven? it just sounds like he is very himself-driven? like he is always doing things because he wants to produce, and create, and like manage, and improve. 



is he also basically motivated by promotions and growth so he can manage more? is that it? it's just a hard to wrap my head around his motivations at work exactly, because of how you know, driven he is by his own ideas. in my experience, those kinds of people are sort of not the ones that exactly adhere to deadlines and company plans and stuff, you know. they kinda... create their own? and like pave the way, sure, so i see him as ambitious, but not really a corporate slave, in a way?



is this interpretation of his work motivations, right, i guess that's what my long-drawn kinda stupid question is sorry","yeah pretty much! I agree with what you said esp that he does it because of his own ambitions not bc he cares about generating value for the shareholders or anything lol. he has really high expectations and standards for himself but he only really feels confident to achieve them if they're in areas he's already good at, and his job is one of those easier areas for him to excel. so he throws a lot of himself into it. again yeah I think it's more for the feeling of success he gets than bc he wants to be a good worker. I think he's lucky with his current job bc I feel like they kinda just let him do what he thinks is best and he can take control of a lot. the whole thing with him wanting promotions and maybe opening his own agency I think is less because he loves to work and more because he wants to be successful in something and this is one of the things he's really good at","15 May, 2024",{'cy'},1353641741,

Another thing that has me questioning everything is the whole ""friend"" circle that tae has, bc like, shitty neglectful parents happen but that friend circle is truly from hell. i am very confounded about how they 1)encouraged tae to seduce kai for revenge 2)acted like tae was the root of all evil 3)repeatedly told him anyone who knows would leave him. they have literally been gaslighting him for yearsss. i really wanna hit them all with bricks. 

i rambled but i'd love to know your point of view as the writer - if tae actually maybe feels more guilty than scared about jk loving him ? if tae's friend group planted the idea that he's unloveable or if they saw tae felt like it and made it worse ? 

also plsss make something bad happen to lev pls pls - like in between two sentences about how he was eaten by piranhas i HATE him.","yessss it's like a two part fear where the more immediate part is him afraid of jk leaving him but then the deeper more horrified part of him is torn up at the idea of jk STILL loving him. and that second part only hits after that first part is removed with jk's 'i love you'



also yes tae's 'friends' are AWFUL. I do think it stems from having those neglectful parents tho bc like pre-college he has only chen, who ends up only lusting after him and then once he starts meeting these people that tell him he's smart and interesting and cool he's gonna do whatever he can to keep them around bc they're the only people that are actually validating him in any way (albeit over the WORST things). I think lev in particular is sooooo devious for all of this bc it's almost like they've all trapped tae with this awful thing he did, and lev uses it to his advantage a lot. I don't think they planted the idea perse but they definitely made it worse. with lev in particular he wants tae so badly for himself and keeps feeding that narrative that tae won't find anyone 'good' to love him (so maybe he might as well get with lev then). 💀 idk if I'll bring up lev again, we'll see...though I do think he's been getting his comeuppance for the last like 15 years bc tae refuses to ever sleep with him again and he's just embarrassing himself at this point bc everyone knows how thirsty he is (i.e. his cringey book 💀) like even chen is dunking on you my guy","13 May, 2024",set(),1353478346,

6447,"ksaaaa i very selfishly wanna know more about tae's perspective on this chapter (i'm talking about le) especially when jk holds him and insists that he loves him aaaand about hanna and jk's bond (i feel like it would further validate how good jk is in his eyes, and that he would be happy jk is seen and loved by someone else) Sooo only if you feel like it, could you please give us some insight into tae ?","jk trying to reassure him that he still loves him is hard for tae to believe because he has the lowest self-esteem on planet earth. in his head it's like 'my family didn't love me even when I was normal, so how can someone now love me after I've ruined myself.' it's a lot for him to process since he's not really learned how to receive love in the first place. meanwhile jk hasn't had much love in his life either but he's learned to thrive in spite of it. like if they were flowers, tae would be an exotic orchid that needs constant attention and care to live while jk is ivy on the side of a house that grows in rain or shine. he's so much better at it and he wants to be the person for tae to give him the care he needs, but it's hard for tae to even accept that he COULD deserve it. or that even if he doesn't deserve it jk wants to give it to him anyways



for jk and hanna he's a little conflicted bc he wants to be that person for her but he knows he's not ready to be. and she recognizes that too. overall tae is like you said seeing how good jk is and how he's someone hanna can lean on, the same way tae does with him. and if he can't be that person for hanna yet he's more than happy to share his own source of strength for now. and I think he really trusts jk a lot too with that bc as we can see hanna kinda looks to jk on how she should feel about tae and the whole situation. so like the massive amount of trust tae puts in him to essentially shape the future of his relationship with his niece...it's just really powerful","12 May, 2024",set(),1353398308,

as in, i dont know how much you plan ahead in your fics but rereading the previous chapters made me realize that le tae was EXTREMELY flirty at the very beginning (hence the cunty tae jokes) but he becomes more like subdued after that, more careful about jk instead of just pushing for attention like he did when they first met and during that first date. 

this isn't really a question, i just really love and appreciate how you developed the character, there truly is a difference from the beginning to now and it feels like a very natural progression. soooo kudos to you ksa, you did it again!",hehehehehe thank youuuuu yeah I feel like he comes on so strong at first and then once he gets a better sense of who jk is and also understands that he wants to pursue jk for only jk-focused reasons he adjusts his approach + it's more like he wants an actual relationship and connection vs. just a kai stand-in. so I think he also shows more of his own personality and what he's truly like without his cunty persona,"12 May, 2024",{'le'},1353412358,

I like that they clarified the « he has a type » thing, my brain was stuck on that — also intrigued that tae only pretended to not remember the night he kissed him… that’s an just weirdly notices and remembers everything👀 

Also the « his last act as Spider-Man is to love » line…. Your mind…. So im guessing he won’t be telling taehyung (but I feel like taehyung may also know with his noticing stuff… I do recall that jk kept his suit in a plastic bag under the kitchen sink - who knows ?)

Anyway thank you for writing this fic and this chapter, gave me a much needed boost this weekend💜","taehyung do be noticing things. though with the pretending not to remember I think a part of him was just really embarrassed at his actions and didn't want it to set the tone of their relationship. bc I think after jk doesn't kiss him back/take advantage of him the realization that he's not kai really sinks in and he's like 'ok, damn. this is a good man and I really don't want to fuck it up'","12 May, 2024",{'le'},1353377203,

when he told jungkook about the first night, and why he was interested, i almost curled up into a ball myself. because the amount of courage it takes: that kind of brutal honesty with your own self, knowing you were wrong, terribly so, knowing you are extremely humanly human, the worst traits magnified, and acknowledging that, accepting that, knowing it could cost you everything. everything. it's so so so brave and rare and he doesn't know it but he's so brave.","le tae makes me cryyyyyy he is so brave and I think he's the only one that doesn't see that. but thankfully jk absolutely does.

No seriously I know tae was a horrible person for doing this to her but he was so justified for feeling good about her downfall after 20+ years of a life ruined by her and their fuckass parents. Maybe I'm harsh but seing as 20 years later she still sees nothing wrong with her behavior 😒 ""i was young"" girl he wasn't ??? Love jk for telling her like it is.

but ideally, i would like tae to find the suit and be like ""oh"" and then be emo about how really good jk is, bc i remember him saying (waaay back in the babka date chapter) that if spiderman was dead, he should be honored - and obviously jk wouldn't want any of that, but i just need jk to get his flowers, and who better than tae to just acknowledge it. idkkkk i trust youuuu <3",interesting.....THESE are the theories you present to me.....,"12 May, 2024",set(),1353494892,

joon: he just gets pampered all day at home they don't let him lift a finger for anything. sometimes they'll go out to eat or something but usually he just likes to have a day off from working and lounge around

cy tae: has lots of ideas but takes forever to finally zero in on what he wants to do. hits the last week of the deadline and he's in crunch mode, pulls a few all-nighters to make it happen but submits with with a few hours to spare. goes out to celebrate after.



noy jk: oof it's rough, this guy doesn't like school and he hates a deadline. jimin and yoongi force him to hit major benchmarks throughout the semester so he doesn't leave it all until the last minute; hates doing it so much but is happy he only has to pull one all-nighter instead of like 12

noy tae: he is in so many study groups!!! he's productive about half of the time and spends the other half just talking so he still has to race to the end, but at least he's got everyone else in the study group doing all-nighters with him



iylm jk: same as calendar jk, but his motivation is reading the new book in the series he loves that just came out

iylm tae: he's been trying all semester to work on it but he still ends up crying at the kitchen table the night before with joonie ala 'your dad helping you with your math homework'. gets an extension every time because every professor is wrapped around his finger and he actually does need them. poor baby tries very hard :'(



skillshare jk: doesn't even bother looking at anything until the month of because he knows himself well enough to know he wouldn't actually do anything earlier than that anyway

skillshare tae: has a color coded schedule he follows religiously that's supposed to have him finish 2 weeks ahead of time but he still ends up in crunch mode right before the deadline because he ends up going down like 5-hour rabbitholes



dna jk: loves the classes that are like 'you can submit these assignments at any point in the semester, pace yourselves accordingly', he submits everything in the last week and still gets an A

dna tae: loves the classes that are like 'you can submit these assignments at any point in the semester, pace yourselves accordingly', he submits everything in the first week and gets an A+



losin end jk: hasn't spoken to anyone in class or the professor once. misses half the sessions. submits it randomly one night with a few days to spare and gets the highest grade

losin end tae: charms his professor into writing like half of it because he hangs out during office hours and talks through his ideas



chingu jk: if he remembers he has it due then he'll turn it in a few days early, though most of the time his professors have no real idea of what he's saying or how to really grade what he's given them

I remembered that back in college scene where taehyung was so angry on jk's teammates when they were talking shit behind his back. He was ready to throw hands but he controlled himself, I know if something like that happened in front of jolie, she'll not hold back. She'll fuck them up by her own way. That's her appa.

also random extra thought but I think his relationship with david deep down really means a lot to him even if he grumbles about it but like he gets to have these bickering pretend angry moments that get tossed back at him and they both know it's a joke, and jk is really grateful to have someone who can see his threatening outsides and poke at him anyway. like along with tae being really tender with him it just affirms like yes his insides are soft, but his outside isn't SO scary that someone is afraid to provoke him. idk I just think it's funny and sweet david doesn't take shit from him and it means more than jk himself probably really knows","10 May, 2024",{'le'},1353161823,

6340,"I love how both your spideys carry guilt in different ways and okay tricky wording, I don't love seeing them make themselves go through all that pain, rather I love seeing your writing and character building skills in practice and what that translates to in each of them. like okay they do seem to coincide in that they don't really allow themselves to mourn or even deescalate traumatic situations to make them more emotionally manageable? but I think readers will agree that we wouldn't say the pain dna jk and le jk make themselves go through is the same in both its intensity and the way they express it and that's what I find so interesting. I'm thinking some of it has to do with their age? I think in general le jk feels a little more grounded with his emotions than dna jk and im guessing that has to do to some point with the fact that le jk is simply older and has had more time to sit and let his emotions simmer (especially since letting go of the mask, like we very clearly see how much that got him doing a lot of introspection work) and this is already longer than I thought lmao would love to hear your thoughts on this!","ahhh this is a great ask!! ok



I think this ties it to something I've touched on before with how they grew up. I wrote one time that losin end jk is my most pure/good character bc he really has no outside forces telling him to be a hero. like he has his grandparents as a kid but then he's on his own for most of his life and even like right after the bite he's living in his neighbor's basement? the support system is non-existent. and still he chooses what's morally right bc that's just what he innately knows is right. whereas dna jk is still doing everything he does for the greater good, but he's also been influenced by jin and joon and wants to make them proud. like if he decided NOT to be spider-man it'd go against everything they taught him



so then tying this into how they process their guilt, part of it is definitely losin end jk being older, but I think the main reason he's more grounded and able to introspect with understanding is because he's been alone in it all. so I think he kinda just has to figure out how to do that as he goes along anyway, or maybe it's something he was naturally all along. like even with the yugyeom thing he locks it away for a long time but he's still able to recognize it's not necessarily his 'fault' it happened. I think he's got a much more 'what happens happens' mindset and knows not everything is black and white that comes from both spider-man experience and general life experience growing up alone



then for dna jk, he SUCKS at introspection like it's painful to write his inner monologue. this guy is constantly wracked with guilt. and the main difference is that he isn't grounded in himself, other people ground him (jin, tae, joon). with jin in particular, we can see how jk advancing his 'real' life with the new job and putting in more effort etc. is directly from jin's influence and wanting to be good for him. but with all this want to do what's right to make jin proud means that jk is really bad at knowing what's good for himself. like he can't differentiate that the general good isn't always in his own best interest (i.e. taking a night off some days and taking a fucking nap). so when he has all these guilty feelings bottled up inside he can't talk to jin about because he has to keep spider-man a secret he doesn't have an outlet to actually process them and understand what is and isn't within his control or his fault. hence why he's drowning in all this self-loathing; it's a double edged sword having support because he's dependent on it but can't be fully supported with the secrets he's keeping","08 May, 2024","{'dna', 'le'}",1353105947,

Or, I could also see the spideys being stealth sneezers. And I'll bet le tae has never had a body function in his life. 



Speaking of sneezes though, have the spideys ever had that incessant need to either sneeze, cough, or giggle at a really unfortunate moment? My personal nightmare was when I had to go to a Quaker funeral and it was so quiet that I had to concentrate as hard as I could not to laugh out of sheer awkwardness. But like, I also have a super expressive face and it was just a torrent of misery.





 Back to Spidey though, or have they had an itch during a stakeout where they couldn't scratch it? What coping strategies would they suggest?","cy jk: the most normal sneeze they could use it as a sound effect

iylm jk: little baby sneeze it's so cute

iylm tae: another violent sneezer only slightly less loud than cy, we're talking gives jin a heart attack loud. tae is both envious of jk's cute sneeze and completely enamored with it



dna jk: has mastered the silent sneeze. if he's in a position where he can't cough or scratch an itch or something he starts counting the periodic table in his head until the urge passes

dna tae: I'm pretty sure it's canon that he too sneezes loudly, I feel like he tries to be quiet depending on the situation but it's always loud



losin end jk: he's gonna sneeze and cough and scratch whatever itch he needs to. I feel like in the early spidey days he tried to be stealthy but as he got older he was like 'fuck it I'm gonna have to fight these guys at some point anyway there's no point being uncomfortable'

losin end tae: no one has ever heard him sneeze or burp or fart or cough or anything. does it happen? maybe. but we'll never know

was just curious about the process for yoonmin in noy, iylm CSS now?,  vs sope, vs namjin, who seem like the go-to for you? what's compelling about namjin :)","hmmm so for calendar I paired yoonmin just because like taekook it seemed like one of the popular ships as I was just getting into bts, and then for noy it felt natural to write them again. same for iylm, and then I think with namjin I just liked the idea of those two characters in iylm interacting together and a lot of them being a couple makes the plot move forwards since they are the ones that get taehyung and jungkook to meet



for dna namjin came back again because I really just love writing jin and jungkook relationships in all my fics, something about them is so compelling to me to write. I myself have not been in romantic relationships but I have a really close family so exploring family dynamics and platonic friendships always interests me with each of my stories. and then joon just felt like the choice for uncle ben; I thought maybe yoongi but I also wanted to write yoongi as one of tae's friends since with noy it was the other way around. and then I was tired of making hobi the odd man out and I wanted to try out sope :) plus I think with having jimin as the cousin and then I was going to make hobi tae's neighbor anyway, so it seemed more natural to have yoongi there too instead of like...jimin's boyfriend who also comes over LOL



for CSS I actually thought about switching up the pairings outside of taekook but they came together more based on which sin each of the boys were. I had the idea of how the different sins would get paired up, and it just so happened that the way I decided who was who became the classic taekook yoonmin namjin situation. I was on the fence about switching hobi and jin but I think I'm happy with how I have it. and then yoongi jimin joon just fit better in those spots than anyone else so I didn't want to change them up.

I honestly have no words to describe just how much of a masterpiece this truly is. I have no idea what I expected when I started this but I can only thank lord now for making me stumble upon this absolutely amazing piece of treasure.

It just seemed so interesting to me and I wanted to read it right then and there, no questions. Matter of fact I have to say I am rendered speechless.



I reckon this was so beautifully well-written, you really have a gift. The way the emotions were portrayed and the descriptions, the dialogues, the mannerisms of the characters dkdjmx just so elegant and graceful and perfect is what it was. This was absolutely wonderfully beautifully crafted. Everything was so real and the feelings and emotions were so humane. Nothing about this felt like a fiction. like I'm so flabbergasted you girl are exceptionally out of this world. Your writing is absolutely fantastic and I can go on and on with complimenting this piece of work.

This was such a delicate piece of writing, written so well just so amazing.



Truly this was so amazing and I wanna thank you for putting this out there and giving me an opportunity to read such a masterpiece in my life. This is definitely a highlight I'll always remember in these past few months of my depressing life. In fact its like one of those immaculate amazing exceptional fics ill always remember reading, loving, devouring and enjoying when im 80 years old ill remember this. So thank you for giving me a memory to always look back to. I had such a fun time reading this and I have so much more to say but I've never been one for words nor is English my first language (it's not even my second third or fourth language-) but I really tried to convey how amazing this was.

Really hope you go far in life and are successful in whatever you hope for. I hope you achieve what you wish for. This was so perfect❤️❤️



You truly conveyed such raw emotions and injected them into the readers blood cells.

Just so amazing god. I really hope youre happy and get all that you wish for in life. This was the best❤️



the way you write its like a spell casted hsbdhsb the flow and everything just so perfect i have no words.

(i really hope this doesn't read as me being nitpicky, as i said at the beginning i am a complete failure when it comes to anything STEM and medicine, aaand i've never had a back/hip/leg issue so it's just out of curiosity that i'm asking)","ahh interesting honestly my main source of information is google, I'm a google fiend. I try my best to make sure things are somewhat accurate, and I think it helps that I usually try to keep it pretty vague so I don't have to be spot on with details



for le jk I think he can still pick up tae bc he's spider-man so he's still got super-strength even though his hip is bad

and then for cy I think him having a bad back is more like something that flares up from time to time rather than a constant pain (though picking tae up doesn't do him any favors) so he pushes himself more than he probably should when it's not bothering him","03 May, 2024","{'cy', 'dna', 'iylm', 'headcanon', 'le'}",1352502436,

iylm jk: will cry if he's too overwhelmed

iylm tae: actually doesn't cry much, though when he's with joon or family he's close to he's more emotional overall so he will cry in front of them



skillshare jk: I feel like he's one of those people that cries when he's angry and can't express it properly

skillshare tae: he doesn't cry often and he tries to make sure nobody sees :(



dna jk: would say he doesn't cry often but jin would heartily disagree. he doesn't cry in front of strangers but around jin he's a crybaby lol

dna tae: tears are WEAKNESS (but actually he doesn't cry much except maybe around Jimin, hates how it makes him feel)



losin end jk: cries pretty regularly actually. he has a lot of grief in his life and he expresses it in a healthy way with the crying (tbh I think losin end jk is somehow one of my more emotionally balanced characters)

losin end tae: the most he's cried recently has been with jk, before that he thought his tear ducts were dried up bc he hadn't cried in like 15 years

6188,hellloooo idk if anyone's asked this before (bc it seems like THE question to ask) but how do you imagine your not-married-yet taekooks proposals would go ? who would ask who ? would it be a big thing or a common decision ? who would randomly elope ? i'm especially curious about skillshare and losin end ?,"I can't remember if I have answered this before or not so I'll do it now!



iylm: mutual decision that they come to only after both of them nearly implode with nervousness of how to do it. they don't elope but they do decide to have a close friends and family only wedding (jin plans it of course) that people don't know about until like 5 months after the fact when photos leak of tae with a wedding ring on



skillshare: I *think* my answer for this before was something like skillshare tae keeps trying to plan these elaborate proposals that never end up working out for one reason or another (like he wants to propose on a romantic rowboat ride but then he falls overboard or something) and I *think* I said something about they end up in the hospital from his hijinks? and then jk just proposes bc he needs to put tae out of his misery. (because obviously he knew from the start but wanted to let tae have his perfect proposal moment)



dna: I think jk proposes but it's really casual like they're in the lab working late one night and he's just like 'marry me'. oddly enough they're the ones that then have their wedding be like a whole big thing bc their friends and family refuse to let it be anything less



losin end: mutual decision that I think is more practical than anything else, like maybe one of them has a medical scare as they get older and they want to make sure legally they're bonded together. it's a quick ceremony at the courthouse and david is for SURE their witness LOL","03 May, 2024","{'dna', 'iylm', 'headcanon', 'skillshare', 'le'}",1352581545,

1. a naked dude threw his own poop at passing passengers in gare de lyon

2. a woman actually gave birth at gare du nord (which is genuinely the most cursed place to be born at i'm sorry)

dna jk: headphones ON music BLASTING he's really the one person that doesn't have to worry about spatial awareness bc spidey sense

dna tae: doesn't take the train very much but when he does I feel like he ends up talking to someone. makes friends with the lady bringing home her groceries or the guy who's taking his son to his first baseball game, etc. sometimes he falls asleep but he rarely misses his stop



losin end jk: rarely takes the subway once he becomes spider-man, but when he does he always tries to give whatever he has when people walk through the trains asking for money, sometimes he's handing them a couple bucks sometimes it's the cup of coffee he just bought (I LOVE HIM)

6086,has their relationship only been ‘fixed’ once jin got sick? i just realized i had sort of assumed that jk had grown out of his emo phase and started being a good nephew at least a while back but was that recent?,"No it’s definitely a more recent development, I think with his character he goes more from emo/reserved in high school to just not really giving a shit in college and then just an asshole when he works for the bugle (not deep down of course but he’s doing it to protect Jin from his real secrets). And the bugle in particular Jin really really disagrees with bc it’s not a morally sound job perse he was essentially like a sleazier version of the paparazzi and 1. Jin felt like he was wasting his potential and 2. It was wrong. So them when he gets sick jk decides he has to make the part of his life Jin does know about better to fix things with him","30 Apr, 2024",set(),1352392735,

cy tae: went on a date with a guy to the movies who refused to answer his questions about the movie because he was mad tae was talking



noy jk: he will always insist it was his date with jin even though they ended up being great friends

noy tae: went out with a guy from another band and he spent the whole time talking about how jazz is dead. AND he didn't want to order dessert



iylm jk: worked up the courage to ask out a cute guy in his class at university and took him to a play, but the guy ended up falling asleep bc he was so bored 

iylm tae: has never been on a date before Jungkook but he has several times been in situations where it is not a date but the OTHER person thinks so and he has to let them down gently



skillshare jk: met a guy for dinner and he was so rude to the staff jk got up and asked for his own table to eat alone

skillshare tae: went to a local fair with a guy and it was actually going great until he got hit by a bumper car and had to go to the hospital for a broken finger



dna jk: reverse here because nearly anyone that's been on a date with him always cites HIM as the worst date they've ever been on because he's either really late or disappears in the middle of it

dna tae: got stood up and waited in his building's lobby for like six hours



losin end jk: had a meet-cute at his local bodega. decided after a few years of total solitude at thirty-six he was going to put himself out there again. asked him out to dinner and they were having a great time until jk discovered he was a flat-earther and didn't believe in space at all

losin end tae: walked 1.5 miles in cunty boots that hurt his feet only to chug four glasses of wine and have to get carried home by his date before throwing up violently in his bathroom and pretty much blacking out. though he would argue it was also his best date



chingu jk: the one (1) time his dad set him up on a matchmaking date with a girl from a good family when he was in college and they sat in uncomfortable silence for the entire meal. when he dropped her off at home he threw up from how nervous he was she would try to kiss him or call him for another date (she was going to do neither)

I feel like the first 5 chaoters will be more intro into characters and the world but then the following 12👀👀👀 i really am curious if the plot will be more character focused (their own inner demons - im sorry for the aquinas level wordplay) or if there will be an adventure, enemies to battle and all👀👀👀

Also, at the end you wrote it‘s the first fic where vmin are not immediate friends but i also feel like tkk kissed in the second chapter no drama full confusion - i really enjoy the dynamic. I feel like they will both have to grow emotionally tho - in terms of attachment since jk sees tae as his pretty thing in a way and tae sees jk as a tool to get what he wants (also pretty)

But then, since the characters are grey, idk if they will keep thus dynamic and remain very demon ?

Just wanted to share with you💜","omg 100 PERCENT I'm gonna have a little more backstory about him in college in the next chapter but I picture it a lot like him being shy and unsure of himself as a freshman and being close with chen, but once he starts getting noticed and gets more involved in the writing program he does build his confidence but also starts building up a wall so he can fit in with all the really shitty/asshole people there. and he TOTALLY had a professor that was picky as hell but he's like the star child of the group","27 Apr, 2024","{'le', 'headcanon'}",1351980775,

Calls jk to let him know he'll be out that day, but jk doesn't think to ask for details and tae doesn't feel the need to give them. Jk jumps to a conclusion, panics and goes to visit tae in the hospital, but obviously tae isn't *staying* at the hospital so he can't find him there. Anyway, they accidentally end up running into each other and JK's holding some wilted flowers🥹 And then it gets awkward for a little bit, but secretly tae is mush.",omggg the way that one scene about tae getting a cramp when he runs down to give jk his glasses was potentially going to be a setup for him having a stress ulcer AHHH this is a really cute scenario and I'm on the fence about going forward with this as a plotline or not.,"27 Apr, 2024",{'chingu'},1352018661,

i'm gonna get a bit personal here sorry in advance for the word vomit aha 🫡 cause I know after most of my uncles passed, almost all my cousins turned to my dad, with him being the only one left (cause his other brother is mentally ill), and he kinda became a replacement to their fathers, but it might just be a cultural thing? idk i feel like jk could be a safe place for the kids even if they're all adults now?



again very sorry about the word vomit 💀💀","yes that one!



omg I've said it before but idk if I have the emotional fortitude to write tae's funeral. I think from the little bit we see of the grieving process with jk and how he calls tae's phone every day to talk to him, I've always thought that the funeral itself he would not be able to really handle - like he would be there, but I don't think he would really plan much or go out of his way to talk to people. I think ji and jolie and the younger members of the family would handle everything. god love that man but tae was cy jk's entire heart and after he's gone jk is never really the same again. I think most of him dies with tae and the last eight months are him just waiting until they can be reunited again



I do have an idea for a chapter post-tae death that's from the grandkids' pov, I may write it but we'll see



for the second part of your question 100%! I think especially jin's girls they'd want to be close to someone that knew their dad so well (bc whether jk likes it or not he and jin were truly besties). for hobi I feel like milo goes to tae, I think they'd have a strong connection bc tae really bonded with him as a baby while he was waiting for jk to be ready for their own kids","22 Apr, 2024",{'cy'},1351785446,
5948,"hiii i have this potentially weird question but like you know how we're all attracted to people for different reasons  (i mean physically) ? like sometimes it's because we simply find them beautiful, sometimes it's because they're not exactly beautiful but more like pretty or cute, and other times because they're charismatic or sexy which is more of a vibe i guess ? 

So anyway, i was wondering how your taekooks found each other attractive - like who saw their partner as beautiful vs sexy vs charismatic vs cute vs... etc ?","cy jk: ""beautiful- no, gorgeous- no, perfection- no, angelic-"" you get it

cy tae: a blend of hot cute sexy and dorky that made him fall to his knees in a grocery store



noy jk: cute (the cheeks the CHEEKS)

noy tae: sexy (the tattoo sleeve the SLEEVE)



iylm jk: confident

iylm tae: pretty. so pretty



skillshare jk: I think once he starts to find tae attractive beyond his looks he really falls for how he carries himself. like his ambition, how sure of himself and authoritative he is. very attractive how he can command a room

skillshare tae: I think he himself can't say what at first makes him attracted to jk he just sees him and feels like everything about him was designed to make tae fall for him. as they get to know one another more he falls for jk's take-no-shit attitude. his blunt honesty is something tae really values



dna jk: his physical beauty yes but more his beautiful mind

dna tae: his good good heart and his strong determination to do what's right



losin end jk: this man was practically a siren with how fast jk falls for his ethereal beauty

losin end tae: fell for his hotness of course but mostly for his calm demeanor. saw a quiet, self-possessed man and fell so fast he helped him build an ikea table



chingu jk: his charismaaaa skillshare tae may command a room but chingu tae can WORK it

But something kinda related that I have been thinking about - bc I reread the party chapter and lev’s reaction to jk’s scars was horrible… and tae and jk did agree to not push each other on their pasts, tae never asked him nor did he act horrified (just a lil shocked) when he saw jk naked… but like, we’ve seen the inside of jk’s thoughts, how he’s been wondering certain things about tae, collecting but not necessarily connecting some dots since the beginning — soooo my question is : did tae do the same ? Does he collect these bits about jk in a corner of his mind and wonder how/why ? Has he made up a potential backstory about jk in his head ? What are his theories about jk ? I’m dying to know how he sees jk since we know how jk sees tae🥺","okkkkk so tae perspective of jk so far:



I think 100% he's been looking and listening and forming some opinions of his own; he's a lot more observant than he lets on (as we see with him clocking jk's busted hip and pushing him towards therapy for it). I think he knows from their first date that jk is a shy man, and probably also figures out that he hasn't been around a lot of people in a while. definitely isn't used to being out and about in society, at least. so even before he sees jk's scars I think he's got a clear enough picture of jk in his head that he's 1. very private and 2. has been alone for a really long time. and after that convo they have about jk's childhood and him getting money from his friend I think tae probably assumes jk has lived a life that potentially involves either some illegal activity or just hasn't been easy on him. and then with the scars that just goes towards the theory that maybe jk has a violent past or has at least had violence done to him, but at that point tae already knows jk's true personality and they both silently agreed not to dig too deep with the other. plus tae has his own skeletons in the closet so honestly I think part of him giving jk space to keep his secrets is because he doesn't want jk to have to dredge up old demons but also because he's not ready to share his own yet","20 Apr, 2024",{'le'},1351245264,

She won't take payment (since because of their kids, DJ feels like a family friend), but she will accept a nice lunch out in lieu thereof. And then, they start hanging out.

cy tae: pierre beauséjour 💀 (alain delon has one foot in the grave)

noy tae: ok his celebrity crush is chet baker who has had both feet in the grave for quite some time so his hall pass is yun sungbin



iylm jk: tae actually is his celebrity hall pass (but also timothee chalamet, jk gets all blushy and tingly when he's on screen, tae notices and he is JEALOUS)

iylm tae: carlos sainz



skillshare jk: dpr ian

skillshare tae: keanu reeves but in a perfect world his celebrity hall pass is sherlock holmes



dna jk: tupac was his celebrity crush his hall pass is the famous soon to be nobel prize winner dr taehyung kim

dna tae: nikola tesla was his celebrity crush (WHERE WAS I PULLING THESE FROM) his hall pass is obviously spider-man



losin end jk: robert deniro, he's updating it to the hot duke from bridgerton after he and tae watched it

losin end tae: anton chekov 💀 updating it to green lightning (only bc he knows it'll drive jk crazy)



chingu jk: gong yoo I feel like he's been in love with that man for years

5710,how would cy tkk (esp tae) react if one of their kids start becoming conscious of their body image,"oh my god this ask shot me in the HEART



honestly I think both of them would be really devastated. I think jk over the years would have be really outspoken about how important it is to love the body you have and to treat it with care and all these other things to try and build their confidence and relationship to their body image in a healthy way, so if he learned that even with all that they still were worried it'd be really upsetting for him because he'd probably feel like he failed like he keeps 'failing' with tae and not being able to just like, magically make his bad thoughts go away. that and he'd be really heartbroken because he's watched tae struggle with it for so many years and he's seen firsthand the toll it takes on him. so like to imagine one of his children going through the same thing it's one of his worst nightmares



tae...I think he'd feel guilty. like questioning how he's acted over the years and what he's said or done and if he's influenced them in anyway with his own negative thinking or somehow made them feel like they should be conscious of their body image too...it would just not be good. I know I wrote about how he and jk try to keep his issues as private as they can but like we see in ji-tae's birthday chapter it's something that they eventually are able to observe and pick up on on their own as they get older. so I think he would take a lot of them potentially feeling the same way as his own fault for not better shielding them and not setting a good example of how they should be connected with their bodies



but all of that is literally the most painful thing I could ever think about so I'm making it officially canon here and now that neither ji-tae nor jolie are self-conscious about their bodies and have great relationships with themselves and their confidence and never have to deal with that ever once in their lives and their parents aren't emotionally ripped apart by that possibility thank you","15 Apr, 2024",{'cy'},1351171001,

5643,"ok so i have another le ask but this one is more for context less about what is to be revealed or not : i remember that scene in the market where the vendor talked about spiderman and how he hadn't been seen in a while and that he was probs dead. Then tae was like oh no and kinda sympathetic to spiderman. 

Anyway, it's like you said, since the fic is so much about the after of being spiderman, i was wondering how it was during ? as in, how did people see and treat spiderman back in the day ? how much would the ordinary person know about spiderman ? how much would they care ? like in the case of tae, how much did he actually hear/know about spiderman ? i'm really curious about this, especially since his disappearance seems to have gone almost unnoticed or at least we don't see it in the fic since it's focused on tae and jk...","I think it's a case of newer younger superheroes coming along. I always imagined he starts out as a teenager just stopping petty crimes and trying to make the city safer in his own small way, and then as he gets older and through college it starts to escalate, and then I forget which chapter in the fic but I mentioned him stopping yugyeom and his dad from blowing up the apartment buildings is like his first huge thing that catapults him into fame. so before that he's more a neighborhood name and kinda just a vigilante, maybe tae and other regular people hear of him just talked about kinda like an urban legend. then the yugyeom thing happens and he's elevated to 'superhero' status, and pretty much everyone in the city knows about him since he starts getting written about in newspapers and things. I feel like then through his twenties and early thirties he's almost a celebrity of sorts, like it's a cool thing if you spot spider-man one day and people are always excited to meet him. but then in the past like 5-8 years new superheroes start popping up and they have flashy costumes and cool powers and all this fancy tech so spider-man can't really compete in terms of a wow factor. I think then his popularity starts to fade as the new people take his place, and a lot of the younger generations don't really know who he is. almost like an eighties heartthrob your parents had a crush on back in the day but you only know them from like a cameo they had in a recent tv show (if that makes sense). his full-on retirement goes unnoticed by most people bc up to that point for a few years now he'd already been falling out of the public eye. that or people that do notice he isn't around anymore probably figure he died or retired since he's been doing it for so so long","13 Apr, 2024","{'le', 'cy'}",1350876926,

5640,"i am still in le mode. and i just want to say, despite everything, despite how burdened they both are, le is the definition of romance to me. the way they fall so easily into each other, and make space for each other (the whole cleaning the closet, literally making space) it’s just so wonderful. all you taekook fluff is so precious and dear to me, it’s different in so many ways but le spells love and romance. It’s not just the love, but also the little things that turn each day into something special. and well because they are rich and kinda retired i just love this mundane feeling of love i get from le, where they don’t have to be “productive” they just fill their days with love. it’s almost like an ideal life. The tiny little things taehyung thinks of, the way jungkook just falls into the reading routines, the babka morning/afternoons, it’s all so lovely. The way Taehyung, who is desired by so many around him, finds something real. And the way Jungkook, who has spent most of his life fixing stuff, surrenders himself to him, and in doing that he fixes Taehyung too. they are love.

5628,"hi ksa, i have a very unrelated to writing life advice question to ask you if you dont mind answering - i'm asking you this simply bc your fics give me the feeling that you are lowkey very wise about people, life, friends and all that stuff... the thing is, i'm 29 now and i feel like i've spent the past 10 years just studying & working with very little time to properly socialize - make or keep friends. i'm also an introvert with a very low social battery so that doesn't help either... what i mean to say is, i experience a lot a of ""adult loneliness"" (seems like a trending topic these days so i guess i'm not alone lmao) but anyway, do you have any advice on how to make friends as an adult?","sorry I left this unanswered for so long! I wanted to give it some good thought before I replied. honestly I feel this sentiment so strongly. I have some close friends in my life but a lot of them live all across the country and I don't see them often. a lot of my days I spend alone and weekends are usually me going out on my own. it's really hard to make new friends as an adult especially when you're used to spending time by yourself. I feel this ask to my core. 



I guess my advice (from someone who's trying to work through this as well) is to force yourself to be in situations. the main thing I've come to realize as I've gotten older is that most of my friendships still exist bc I'm the one reaching out. it's annoying and I feel like as an introvert sometimes the last thing you want to do is ask someone to make plans with you but if you don't they probably won't either. everyone's always so busy so they're probably struggling to socialize too. from what I've found with a lot of my adult friendships is the other person almost always wants to hang out they just haven't had time to ask me first.



as far as net new friends go, this is stupid but it's true - find people who have the same hobbies as you! there's a lot of facebook groups, discord chats, etc. (even the ksa group chat lol) that's full of people who share mutual interests and I've found as an adult that's the easiest way to meet new people you have a good chance of getting along with. even if it's just joining a discord or something that's putting yourself out there more than you have. 



and then my final piece of advice which kinda goes against my other point, don't put pressure on new friendships! if you end up joining a group or force yourself to go to a social event I would say don't go with the mindset that you HAVE to meet new people. I've found that bc life can get so busy it's hard to keep 50 different people in mind all the time. I've had a lot of my friendships fall off over the years as we've all just gone out of touch, but the ones I do still have are so much deeper and important. so don't put pressure on your interactions, what will be will be","12 Apr, 2024",{'noy'},1349717486,

He has all this guilt going on, together with the loneliness and self loathing, and everyone involved in what happened keeps telling him he’s the worst for it but SURPRISE HE IS ONLY ONE (1) HUMAN and there’s AT LEAST three people involved. 



From the way you’ve described their life before college, I’m more inclined to 👀 Jeanine. Popular girl, favored by her parents, the world revolving around her… of course she believes she did no wrong. HOW VERY INTERESTING 🥴 Babes you got pregnant from a guy you swore off for the sake of your brother! Like ofc Tae seems like the bigger villain because there’s a baby involved, but at the end of the day if Hana didn’t exist… in simple terms it’d go sort of like “Jeanie broke the promise to her brother and still went for Kai, and then Tae took revenge by taking Kai for himself”. Again, still shitty, but Tae is hardly the only one to blame yet seems to be the one bearing the worst of it. AND KAI??? Like hun no amount of temptation can take you away from a responsibility you actually want to do right by so excuuuse me but boy simply didn’t care to be Hana’s dad lmao.

It's been mentioned that he's a messy drunk, and now he's characterized as the drunk boy in the book. I'm guessing he made a desperate, messy choice while vulnerable and has been atoning for it since. His sister also does not seem like a good person with how she was likely used to getting whatever she wanted (parents favored her, she also hung out with cool kids). Maybe there was jealousy at play from her side too once Tae started getting so much attention? Anyway, I think Tae's truth is harsher to himself than the objective truth. And I don't think Jeanine's perspective is honest.",hmmmm much to think about!!! many perspectives but whose is the truth...,"12 Apr, 2024",set(),1350755102,
5606,"Rereading this chapter again…

« Well, hang on.” Taehyung gets to his feet (much more gracefully than Jungkook’s been able to do all day) and steps over to rifle through the discarded clothes. “These will all probably fit you.”



He pulls out a sweater and holds it up to Jungkook’s chest, debating. “All my things are too tight across the shoulders. I think this would be better.”



Jungkook obligingly puts the sweater on when Taehyung prompts him too, and it does fit well. Better than Taehyung’s clothes, like he said. “Where did all of this come from?”



Taehyung shrugs. “Oh, you know. Thrift stores, vintage, all that. Sizing is tricking sometimes.”« 



^^this is what jk thought of after realizing Kai and tae had been together… 

But rereading it now, im curious about why tae kept his clothes and how tae knew Kai’s apartment so well if it really only lasted two weeks - im thinking it turned into a toxic situation ship ?

Im also wondering what tae’s intention was in keeping those clothes and dressing jk up in them - it kinda makes me sick to think that he may have been trying to recreate the life what he couldn’t with Kai with jk, that he almost used jk as a mockup Kai ??? im also saying this bc of how much kai and jk apparently look alike

And like, dont get me wrong, i do believe that tae does feel affection for jk but idk regardless of past mistakes etc, dressing your current partner in your ex‘s clothing that you‘ve kept and refuse to throw out is☠️☠️☠️

Im genuinely more upset about this bit for jungkook than about anything else, bc what happened with jeanine 20 years ago is none of his business actually - but being used as a remplacement kai is very much his business☠️☠️","ok to be fair right after this part tae says jungkook should have his own clothes and not wear these. jk is the one who keeps the suit so he can wear it for yugyeom later on



but yes much more to uncover about tae and kai and jeanine and how everything all went down there","12 Apr, 2024",{'le'},1350777905,

and especially when compared to dna, like dna jk is a gem of a person and a real hero but he also has heroes of his own in his life (jin, joon, even tae) to look up to and to kind of guide his moral compass? he has something personal to protect when he's out protecting the city, he's making his uncles proud even if they don't know it and that definitely pushes him to keep going



meanwhile le jk's grandparents are out of his life in any major way by the time he's 13 and from then on the only real connection he has is with yugyeom who a lot of the time is another person for him to save. so just like thinking about how he gives everything to protect and save and has no real reason to. other than that he can. so he will. and it makes me cryyyy","12 Apr, 2024","{'dna', 'le'}",1350829993,

having a twin who is always loved more and has all the attention can be so alienating and lonely, and obviously it sometimes manifests in really unhealthy ways, like the immense insecurity that taehyung has, but i completely see him as someone who just wants to be loved, despite all his flaws, and he tries, he tries every day. he is so thoughtful and considerate in the way he handles jungkook, and i think no one can be more unkind to him than he is to himself. so he repents. twenty years is a long time to repent. in now way denying that he FUCKED UP and like BAD CALLS bruh, but i am eager for the rest of the facts to wholly judge him for a 20-something-year-old's gross mistake made over a disillusioned need to be loved.","yes they are so HUMAN it hurts. especially tae

either way, what really broke my heart was how convinced taehyung was that it was over ""promise you'll say it one more time in the morning"" really killed me :( he, god, he is so terrified of losing jungkook, and he thinks he has.

and yes he's 100% so scared to lose jungkook. it really is an awful thing that he did so I think even when they first get together he's got it in his mind that if he does ever tell jk his secret their relationship will automatically be over. which I also think goes hand in hand with the 'proving his love' thing some other ccs have been talking about - the fact that he's willing to lose everything bc he wants jk to know him completely and doesn't want any secrets between them anymore...idk I feel like that's love","10 Apr, 2024",set(),1350687958,
5551,"Alright I finally read the update after re reading the entire fic in like a day because the first time I read it I was confused as I haven't read the fic it in a while, and I must say, I'm still a bit confused 💀.

I think I need more context, I know you'll provide that in next chapter of course and I'm again eagerly waiting for the next (not pressuring you in any way). Also I did not expect the secret to be this. Like all that theories and the actual story is like 180° to each other. I really love your brain. for the first time in your story I felt skeptical about tae. Like this tae is more dark and maybe more human(?). It's such a paradox, this story and taekook are as close to reality as a character can possibly get (I mean being grey instead of black and white, which is how actual human beings are) out of every fan-fiction I've read till now, even though it's spideyverse!! I'm also not gonna jump to conclusions about tae's the only one at fault or done something bad, we don't know the the full story yet. Also I read all your replies to other cc so I understand a bit about tae's insecurities and his need to seek validation and love and his fear about jk leaving him. I'm actually worried abiut how all this baggage will unfold and the story will conclude in like 2 chapters 🙂. I mean we still don't know full context of secret, how jk's gonna react to it and what will happen to their relationship and will tae ever know about jk being spiderman and many more questions... But I trust you.

One last note : I just realized both spideykoos and us are literally on cliff rn💀.","don't worry yes more context is coming!! as of now all you have is what jk has which is like...hardly anything. at this point we only know the outcome, not the journey to getting there.



and YES that's what I wanted from his secret, something that felt human and dark instead of like 'he was secretly the green goblin all along'. I wanted it to be more grounded and I feel like the added element of his twin sister makes it that much more like 💀 don't worry, knowing me I'll add another chapter if I feel like I need to

I think it's the same thing of Lev and his editor wanting him too and he doesn't accept. I think what tae really wants is just love that's reciprocated on both sides and love that isn't from lust after his looks or his public persona. like at the end of the day he rejects Lev one bc he SUCKS but also bc he knows what lev loves about him isn't his real self. and then with Chen I think he's blinded by his own platonic affection for him, like he doesn't even see Chen as an option.

1. another guy shows up and reveals that everything tae did with jk was the same as what tae did with him when he moved in a few years ago (came over, invited him to dinner, fell into a relationship really fast + moved in together) but they eventually broke up a few months before jk moved in. jk has to grapple with if their relationship is genuine or just a copy of what taehyung lost



2. jk finds out that tae's been writing about him ever since the night they met and only stops right after they go to yugyeom's grave. he starts questioning if everything they have together is just bc tae wanted a good story after not being able to write for so long



3. a combo of the two, in that the man comes to reveal they were living together AND tae was writing about him and jk should investigate if the same is true for him





ultimately I went in another direction with tae's sister and everything in the past bc I felt like those three were just too irredeemable. like it's one thing for tae to do something awful to someone else a long time ago and clearly repent from it, but I didn't think I'd be able to write him successfully atoning for what he would've been doing to jk. a bit too much of a relationship-ender, I think","10 Apr, 2024",{'le'},1350619374,

what blow my mind was the secret, because yeah when taes sister come up, i guessed the book was about her too (my guess was the drunk guy) also because of how much she hated the whole book thing lol but I DIDNT EXPECT THE CHARACTERS TO BE INVERTED LMAO that was definitely a lot

NOW my people on other ccs, why being so harsh with tae😭😭😭😭 like yeah its definitely a shitty move im not justifying it, but give the guy a break, at 23 we are all over the place PLUS he is obviously a person that needs love and for what we've gathered through the chapters, with their parents it wasnt the easiest, so leave the cunty king alone😭 he did shit, we all have and i think its human, his secreat and his mistake

and i totally disagree with him using jk, because he probably saw another lonely person that could give and take love from each other and i dont see the bad in it

that centers my next comment because i dont see why he is sooo concerned about the secreat i mean of course he's nervous about it and insecure but its not like he KILLED SOMEONE and even if jungkook definitely NEEEDS to do more digging about the whole mess (its a family show! ITS A MESS) i think he will eventually understand and leave it in the past

at the end of the day, as ksa said, its a story about what comes after, for jungkook as former spiderman and tae overcoming his family mess

yeah I agree that he wasn't using jk, I wonder if people think that bc in their relationship he's the one that's more vocal about needing reassurance whereas jk kinda just is grateful to bask in the light of tae and his nipples. also true IT'S NOT LIKE HE KILLED SOMEONE like I feel if he knew what actually happened with yugyeom and jk was like 'yeah well he was still my FRIEND' then maybe he wouldn't be so worried. but at the same time the people he hurt with said secret like hate his guts sooooo much for it as we can see and not to mention his asshole friends who he knows very well are assholes never really tell him it's okay? like their vibe is 'what you did was dark and fucked up but we like it bc we're awful people too'. so really I think tae is just not used to being around someone who is genuinely a good person and he can only assume when jk learns he's not good that he'll be disgusted and leave

I think part of it is him punishing himself but the other layer is that he doesn't feel love for those people the way he does for jk. and even though their relationship starts from a place of loneliness (and on jk's side too) I do think what happens between them is actual love.



as for proving himself I think he's already done that more than he (or maybe jk or even us) realizes. like he involves himself in jk's life, helps him with his own problems and encourages his own healing journey, he opens his life up more to jk even though he knows it'll mean his bad past will resurface, and then he's also trying to take his life in a better direction by dropping his friends after jk talks to him about it. I think with all the craziness of the chapter it's easy to forget he was going to tell jk about this anyway, once jk finished the book. and then obviously he just gets the worst luck ever and it all spirals out before he's able to explain himself and now he's sure it's all gonna be over","10 Apr, 2024",set(),1350703645,

what jolie gets from jk: his temper LOL, tugging on someone's hair to show affection, his drive

noy jk: two left feet - the only dancing he does is slow dancing with tae bc of course he won't refuse him

noy tae: he's a musician he can feel the rhythm! 



iylm jk: hates dancing unless everyone else around him is dancing too

iylm tae: loves to dance - he's not the best at it but his enthusiasm makes up for it; one of those people that goes out alone on the dancefloor and then has everyone joining in bc it looks like he's having so much fun. truly the perfect wedding guest he always gets the party going



skillshare jk: has like 4 basic moves he sticks to, king of low effort just dance

skillshare tae: skillshare tae is a FANTASTIC dancer but only after you get some drinks in him



dna jk: very familiar with the stand in one place and just kinda move to the beat

dna tae: not a big dancer now obviously 🫠 but when he was younger he was so bad lol for sure two left feet but he would have fun anyway



losin end jk: has no sense of rhythm whatsoever but if he explored it he'd be excellent at something more acrobatic. I can see him being a really good ballet dancer

losin end tae: he's fine but he prefers talking over dancing



chingu jk: he's a great dancer but he only does it alone in his apartment. bodies kpop choreo and always learns the dances

chingu tae: a good dancer especially with a partner - it gets very steamy when he's on the floor","09 Apr, 2024","{'cy', 'noy', 'iylm', 'dna', 'headcanon', 'skillshare', 'chingu', 'le'}",1350063138,

bc if i get home and my non kpop stan friend tells me she’s dating jungkook im setting a building on fire you don’t know him like i do","ok no but the roommate's COUSIN??? like imagine you visit your cousin at school and he has this cute shy roommate who you flirt with the whole week you're there and then finally he gets the hint and you sleep together before you leave for a semester abroad, and then the next year you come to visit again thinking maybe you'll connect again with the cute roommate and have a nice little hookup only for your cousin to be like ummm sorry he's actually dating mega-famous supermodel kim taehyung so...



no but true I want to have at least a scene or two with the roommate in the sequel because in my mind he's like a huge factor of jk coming out of his shell at college and making friends before tae enters the picture. I feel like he'd be so in shock at first but then ultimately happy for jk for coming out of his comfort zone more to start dating. for sure he'd be gagged but then once jk explains they know each other through family I think he'd be a lot more chill about it. and then once he stops freaking out over taehyung in the flesh in his dorm he'd be like -- alright, here's my other 10 celebrity crushes, do you know them and can you set me up with them...



also I know he'd tease jk about the wattpad of it all bc for sure jk knew nothing about tae's career when they started rooming together he's so 'read a book at the concert' coded and the roommate would never let him live it down","06 Apr, 2024",{'iylm'},1350324438,

Do you have any like tv or movie character who may be his level of scarred in mind ? Since he really expected tae to Not even want to sleep with him after seeing the scars, I’m really curious if he has a form of body dysmorphia",hmmmm I'd say maybe somewhere in between? but leaning more towards it actually is. like I picture it very 'splatter paint' almost where overall he's got scars across his whole body but they aren't necessarily super closely packed together except maybe a few places on his arms or chest. I feel like the him not expecting tae to want to sleep with him is partly just panic over not having had sex in a while and then knowing that his body doesn't look like what a 'normal' 40 year old's would/it would probably make tae suspicious of what exactly he'd been up to in his life.

iylm: I think I said they would be involved in a lot of childrens charities bc of tae's childhood as an orphan and jk just having a shit childhood overall, they would probably adopt more than a few kids of different age ranges and use their wealth to provide homes for as many as they could



skillshare: I remember saying when they have kids they'd take after jk with their humor so tae would be the main one to get teased out of them like he comes home from work and boom he's in the trenches. but then also he's the one that gets smothered with affection every four to five business days when they all try to show they love him a lot too



dna: no kids! I think jk has enough on his plate being spider-man lol but even beyond that I don't think having kids is something he's really ever thought about or wanted? and then same with tae, he's got his career and that's really all he needs

“Do you write letters?” Jungkook asks.

“Sometimes. I never end up sending them.”

“Who do you write to?” 

“Oh, you know.” Taehyung fiddles with a lock of Jungkook’s hair. “My family.”



I say it's not just his family, fiddling with stuff while trying to sway convo is peak liar behavior. But idk WHO he's writing to, THAT is  part of the secret I think. Will come back as i find more clues (i feel like i may end up becoming a complete conspiracy theorist about everything tae says in this fic with the way things are going)",👀👀👀👀👀,"01 Apr, 2024",{'cy'},1349549247,
5399,"ok so since we're clearly all just spiraling over LE - i'm gonna take one last shot : in that tombstone scene, tae recognized yugyeom's name - they actually had a convo questioning if they crossed paths before -- bc yugyeom was the friend of a friend. so tae kind of acknowledged he may have indirectly known yugyeom. which goes to confirm that previous theory about how if tae knew yugyeom, it must have been with a fake name. maybe they met at a party, hit it off, but yugyeom said he was called xy... jk also talked about how yugyeom started talking to him less and less towards the end, only texted him gum from time to time... aside from turning evil and trying blow up stuff, maybe yugyeom was trying to escape everything about who he was - unfortunately including jungkook ? maybe he met tae during that time and it became his alternate life for a while ???

idk i'm also very conflicted about whether yugyeom really did care about jungkook... like yes, but i also no ? bc jungkook has not gotten over his friendship (aside from the traumatic death) for 20 years. i wonder if he ever saw jungkook as a burden or maybe blamed him for things bc everything was going to shit in his own life... or maybe he wanted to keep him away to protect him ? 

it will be so funny if none of the theories are true and you made up a completely different, has nothing to do with aaaany of this type of secret. but then what could be so bad ? the only thing i know is, jungkook is familiar with physically hurting people, having to do it, so it can't be like a real crime. in that party sequence, he kinda asked if tae had been taken advantage of and not sexually/physically and when tae said i know, he just thought of tae's family. maybe tae was implying he himself took advantage of someone, emotionally i mean. bc that's something that would impact jk and his perception of tae. 

and the last bit of the last chapter where jk starts reading tae's book.. tae's note saying everything in this book is a lie... what could it possibly mean ? did he make up a horrible story about someone, making them look bad despite being innocent and ruined their life or something ? but the book is not famous for that. 

anyway, even tho the other anon mixed dna and le up, i think it is plausible that yugyeom could be alive - would be a grand plot twist, but i'm hoping if he somehow did survive, that he didn't keep being evil... gonna read le again to find answers now",hehe very excited to hear what you find...,"01 Apr, 2024","{'dna', 'le'}",1349525299,
5398,"I’m the other anon again and I must say, this theory makes soooo much sense bc the name thing has been bugging me too. I’m also thinking like I’m convinced tae knew yugyeom but he definitely wasn’t there for the funeral if he didnt recognize the tombstone and everything. Meaning he maybe didnt know yugyeom died ? They just had a horrible breakup (as friends or maybe as something else idk)

I’m also wondering then if yugyeom ever spoke about jk to anyone or if he used a nickname. 

Also also with that niece preview you had shared…I feel like she wont be evil but she will spill some tea that will lead to secrets being exposed which will make her seem evil.

Another thing I’m stuck on is that tale metaphor… tae having these toxic people leeching off of him and jk getting hurt trying to help him. Also parallels what eventually happened with yugyeom. And like tae actively punishing himself…

And the final thing is how observant tae actually is - he noticed jk’s hip without jk openly saying anything, he also knew jk hadn’t won the lottery. Him seeing the scars and jk sometimes disappearing at first, I don’t think he’s as aloof as he pretends to be.

I was so sad when he got veneers! I don't think his look /that/ crazy but it's definitely a different look. same with nayeon from twice that devastated meeeee again they don't look bad she just looks different. I feel like getting your teeth done is similar to getting a nose job in that it's replacing a very unique part of your face and afterwards it can make you look just...less? esp in the age of insta-face or whatever its called where people are all starting to look alike. I think hold onto your unique features even if you are a little insecure about them bc at the end of the day they make you you! also veneers as a concept scare me bc what do you mean there's just little nubs under there...

... a little unusual question, but I know that you've written a fic about the show 'the untamed', so... Did you watched it subbed or dubbed?? Actually I wanted to watch the show for a long time and finally found some time but I've never watched any c-drama, I watch k dramas and animes and mostly I prefer sub.

I don't really know how to go about this rn I usually ask someone who already watched it, I'm asking you this time 😅, can you guide me??","honestly I'm not even sure there's a dub option! I watched the sub, I'd recommend that 100%. although I learned that's actually technically a 'dub' as well since c-dramas have to be the standard mandarin dialect but when they film on set I think the actors just speak in whatever regional accent they may have. the more you know lol","01 Apr, 2024",set(),1349879063,

noy: tae tries to the classic pranks but he always laughs beforehand and gives himself away. jk never pranks tae but he's a god at pranking everyone else bc he never breaks. told jimin one year wendy williams friended him on fb and jimin believed him for a solid 2 days



iylm: they team up to prank namjin that they got married, the rest of their friends are in on the bit and even though jin's mom had no idea she gets it instantly and is like 'well yeah, didn't you know?' and jin is GAGGED for about an hour



skillshare: jk's never participated but I feel like tae's family would go HARD on april fool's so he's constantly suspicious of anything jk does that day bc his sister calls him the day before and warns him to be on the lookout. turns out the prank was just her making him paranoid for no reason lol



dna: no pranks but tae is making at least four terrible april fool's puns



losin end: they're too old for that. let them rest.

(and tae and jk having potentially crossed paths) I realized something that was kind of in our faces the whole time : When thinking back to yugyeom, jk always mentions how he had substance issues, how he always got hammered at parties that jk had to pick him up from --- and with the book, there's a drunk boy and a blue haired boy. On their first failed date, jk said he thought tae was the blue haired one bc he seems more confident and tae was a bit surprised. Jk thought he was wrong but maybe he was right ? maybe the whole book is a very explicit tear down of yugyeom, who IS the drunk boy. So if jk reads the book, he will realize that taedid something that made yugyeom spiral and have the ending he had... but idk what to make of tae's family or his ""friends""... 

Also, like, i know (and hope) you go for happy endings, but idk how jk could make peace with that type of information. I also am dying to know how tae will find out jk's spiderman.

5308,"ig it does make sense, i am not sure i completely saw with the whole mom situation the same way tho, because the way jk deals with things is quite unhealthy in the other extreme of the spectrum – repressing, and while i see that tae probably does project his helplessness of losing time with someone so integral to your existence a bit, he kind of tries to push him into simply being more unfront and a tad confrontational about his feelings? Idk if i am saying it right. I just think, that’s not just a “tae” reaction, it’s an everyone default reaction, especially when it’s a person like tae, who has never seen jk’s mom in action. Once he sees how it is, I think tae recognizes that there is no point trying to project his feelings with Lolly there bcoz the dynamic is simply too different. 



And like, I /get/ what you mean, largely; and i completely see the empathy being double-ended sword because it often ends up that way, left unchecked. i just think, if i were in tae’s place, it /would/ be hard to not take some things personally. they both have their trauma, but jungkook’s manifests so hugely, and he is sooo broken up over it, that tae’s sometimes needs space and it probably makes its presence known that way. Not that Jungkook isn’t dearly supportive of his feelings of loss. 



all i am saying is it’s not NOT a flaw, but a very understandable flaw. 



idk if my response made any sense lmao i dunno what the point of it was, just that, i see you handled noy tae with the tenderest of hands, and honestly i have no complaints. i see his struggles clearly; but he is such a sweet dear, that even his flaws try to spare the other person too much pain imo. nvm i will stop rambling!



 I love noy jk! i wish i had a noy tae in my life!!!! i love you ❤️‍🩹",yes understandable flaw is exactly what I meant to say!!

5292,"i was doing /a loooot/ of thinking about your characters... for reasons... and i was wondering



what are noy tae's biggest flaws? i get that his unwillingness to move on from the big bad things, and his losing touch with present-reality as a result are big ones. but more, like... as a partner? not that i mind, he's my darling boy too, i was wondering if i missed anything though, because to me, he just simply feels like a really really sweet partner.



noy jk deserves him for sure, but damn, he is lucky <3","ooooo this is such a good ask!!



you hit the nail on the head with him not being able to move on from things. I'm pretty sure jk says at some point tae's biggest flaw is how kind he is and people can take advantage of that. although I think that's more of a flaw that hurts him over other people, and mostly why he feels relatively flawless.



BUT if I had to pick a different flaw that negatively affects other people and specifically his relationship it'd be that he takes everything personally. I'm thinking of that one scene in the second book where he wakes up to jk crying and pushes him to talk about it even when jk doesn't want to. and then bc he takes everything personally he views it as jk not wanting to talk to HIM and that jk must not like trust him enough or love him enough to open up. cue him going to sleep in the other room like seconds later and not even entertaining more of the conversation until jk goes after him. same thing with him pushing jk to reconnect with his mom, I feel like the advice he gives comes from a heavily biased position on his part bc he relates it to his grandmother. so then even when jk's mom full-on bullies him and jk wants to break things off with her he tells jk to keep at it bc again, he's thinking from his own perspective.



idk how well I'm explaining it but to me I think it's like the huge amount of empathy he has is a double-edged sword because on the one hand he feels for everyone all the time, but then so much of the way he displays that empathy and compassion is through a lens that makes sense to him (rather than trying to put himself in the other person's shoes). though I do think he gets better at it as the series goes on especially with jk, like when he finally admits that he can't help jk alone or when jk comes home from his time at the clinic and tae tells him he's been working to make sure he doesn't mix jk's situation up with how things were with his grandmother.



so basically he cares for people tremendously but he only knows how to care for them in very specific ways. and if that's not received well or not reciprocated he shuts down. does that make sense?","25 Mar, 2024",{'noy'},1349309666,

and then 2. I think he needed to be able to fully immerse himself in his mental health journey and not have any distractions. I feel like it's actually a pretty big growth moment of him deciding to do that instead of just doing virtual stuff bc like we see in earlier chapters he's wrestling with the idea of putting tae first since tae always hides his own feelings. but for something like that I think he has to put himself first otherwise it'll keep eating at him. I think there's a line in there at some point about him having to do it alone bc the problems he wants to resolve started before tae and they're there after him, and jk has to learn how to deal with them internally since tae can only do so much. hopefully that all makes sense!","25 Mar, 2024",{'noy'},1349339258,

I think jk reads fanfic pretty religiously but as he gets older and life gets more hectic it happens more and more sporadically. though yes I do think he stumbles across a popular one-shot and it's like word for word something that happened between him and tae like 4 years ago...but by that time the acct that wrote it is orphaned so it's impossible for him to track down all the connected ones.

and then as he gets a little older he wants to start being like a superhero too so he figures ok just do everything appa does. 

and then as a teen that moves away from 'I want to be a superhero' bc he's like okay that's silly and unrealistic, so then it's just fully 'i want to be like appa'. 

and then as a young adult it moves from exactly the same in every manner and more like 'would he be proud of what I'm doing what would he do in this situation' etc bc he still idolizes jk even if he knows it's silly to want to do EVERYTHING the same","21 Mar, 2024",set(),1348952663,

and even though teeth arnt bones does the regeneration thing apply to them… imagine him just regularly having to go to the dentist for chipping :(( 





sorry but this has been on my mind since i read the chapter 🤕","kinda wanna steal all these descriptions you wrote bc they're so visually good ok to answer each question:



- for sure feels like stinging and probably kinda itchy? very prickly/stinging since his bones are growing back together

- I think it stays pretty much the same speed all the way through

- anything above a hairline fracture he can hear it with his super hearing and if it's a full snap it's audible to other people too

-  yes it would sound wet! idk why but I feel like it would kind of sound how chewing on a pickled radish sounds... 

- depends! if the bones are at a weird angle he will since his body will just fuse back together no matter what position he's in

- also depends - if it's painful enough it'll keep him awake but I think usually he just conks out and lets it work its magic

Chapter 2: As she scurries down the hall after Dr. Sims, Jungkook steps back into the elevator and rides it one more floor up to he and Taehyung’s office.



Chapter 3: The sound of heels clicking across the floor ECHO down the hall, and Jungkook glances out to see the receptionist from his first day making her way towards him.



Chapter 6: He ruffles TAEHYUNG hair, ignoring Taehyung’s indignant huff. “Got anything to eat?”



Chapter 7: Jungkook stares that the wall, not sure what to say next. He isn’t exactly about to dress down his own boss for being late to work.’



Hoseok trails off, but Jungkook finishing his train of thought well enough.



Chapter 8: He takes two deep BREATHES, forcing himself to calm down. He’s so, so relieved.

i love dna! since that happened to me i didn't allow myself to read a story with a character grieving, in 7 years yours was the first one. it made me feel i wasn't alone.

5084,longest period of time your tks spent not talking to each other because of a silly fight? and how did they apologize? (my english is bad sorry),"cy: I feel like longest for them especially if it's over something silly is like max one day. if they fight in the morning before work they're making up later that night, they have too much going on with the kids and their daily routines to spend time being mad at one another. jk will always come to tae after he's calmed down and then they'll talk it out



noy: oh my god these saps aren't lasting longer than 30 minutes. remember the fight they have when tae goes to sleep on the futon so jk follows instead of them staying in their perfectly good bed? yeah they can't be mad at each other for more than like an hour tops. even if they're hurt still they might talk it out at a later point but they can't be actively mad for very long at all



iylm: I feel like their fights are never really silly bc they would only fight over serious stuff. I'm thinking when they're actually in person together it's like a half a day max and if they're doing long distance they won't text for a day or two until one of them breaks the ice. I feel like their unspoken rule is the person who starts the fight has to be the one to reach out to reconcile



skillshare: hahahahaha these two fight all the time over silly stuff it's their love language. I don't think they ever stop talking to each other even if they're in the middle of a fight they'll just keep going about their day bc they know they'll resolve it eventually



dna: they don't really fight lol



losin' end: maybe like half a day? they really only have each other so they can't afford to stay mad at one another. I feel like it's tae that always comes to jk afterwards bc jk always overestimates how long tae will stay angry



chingu: like 2 weeks for sure. I feel like they get in a dumb fight right before jungkook goes on a solo trip and tae only communicates with him the whole time in the most business professional manner. jk never apologizes bc as the boss he doesn't have to lol","17 Mar, 2024","{'cy', 'noy', 'iylm', 'dna', 'headcanon', 'skillshare', 'chingu'}",1348422780,

cy tae: with the TRASH ex. I think he gets overwhelmed while it's happening bc it's not really what he imagined

noy tae: has the best experience of anyone for sure. is still friends with the guy to this day even though they broke up but he had the whole rose petals candlelight nice dinner experience LIKE HE DESERVES and of course made a jazz playlist for it. looks back on it fondly



skillshare jk: his friend from college who also wanted to get some experience. they 'practiced' a lot together before they both found people to date seriously

skillshare tae: tried for the rose petals candlelight nice dinner but ended up getting broken up with that night 😭 instead goes out with his friends who want to cheer him up and he ends up hooking up with a stranger in the bar bathroom. kinda loves it bc he's never done something that crazy before



dna jk: bugle coworker that was hot and flirted with him a lot, they hooked up at the guy's apartment on his last day after everyone went to a bar to celebrate him quitting. jk snuck out after (of course)

dna tae: I know in my heart he was at some science conference out of town and met a guy from another country that romanced him up to his hotel room. overall it was nice bc I refuse to give dna tae anything else. one of those ships in the night experiences for sure. also I feel like it happened within like the same year he meets jk, with all his recovery stuff he'd be a late bloomer



losin end jk: tbh I think even he doesn't remember much of it at this point but it was definitely at a yugyeom party and he didn't realize that's where it was going until it happened. 

losin end tae: I think it happens relatively late for him since he wasn't noticed much until college. he gives me the vibe of never getting asked out bc everyone assumes he must already be in a relationship since he's so good looking. so the first time it does happen he pretends he's done it before but he's actually crazy nervous

skillshare: I feel like it was kinda chill? like they're both adults and I think they've both been in relationships before so there wasn't a lot of nerves in that regard. also I feel like bc of the half-body swap they'd be weirdly very comfortable with each other's bodies? idk I'm just picturing it as something that happens casually one afternoon

cy tae: silver foxxxxx



noy jk: I think he would get hair implants bc tae likes his hair so much haha

noy tae: proudly buzzing it off once it starts to go



iylm jk: I can so picture him having gray at the temples like comic book style

iylm tae: from all the maintenance over the years it stays put pretty well. also since he's always wanted to dye his hair I think post-model life he dyes it fairly often



skillshare jk: something in my heart tells me he has an agressive widow's peak but he makes it work

skillshare tae: I forget where the ask is but there was a question about if they would go to the past or the future which would they choose and I said skillshare jk would go to the future to see if tae's hairline really recedes like he swears it's doing. I feel like it would a bit but not as bad as tae's expecting



dna jk: with his abilities he doesn't go gray for a really really long time but I can see him dyeing it to match tae so he won't be self-conscious

dna tae: I think he goes gray like early forties just from all the stress in his life but he really rocks it



losin end jk: gets gray hair wayyyy late but for most of his life has rich luxurious hair and it kinda makes tae insane that he doesn't have to do anything

losin end tae: silver fox but also he WORKS with the oils and the scalp massages and everything to keep his hairline correct

I imagine they wouldn't have talked too much during that summer but then after seeing each other back at school I feel like the rest of their friends would be like 'ok enough is enough you both like each other'



noy: oooo this is tough bc I feel like if tae doesn't confess then jk doesn't blow up on him and doesn't meet the grandmother. and if he doesn't meet her they aren't close enough when she passes for them to have that whole 'I'll wait for you' convo so I feel like if anything they'd maybe get together like a year after that?? I think they would keep in touch through Jimin but with tae being gone for like two months the closeness they had would fade a bit I think. and by then even if jk knows tae doesn't have a girlfriend I think he would want to do some more internal work before getting into a relationship. so I do think yes they'd get together but the circumstances and also the nature of their relationship I think would be very very different



iylm: ok these guys if they never confessed their feelings I fully believe they're reuniting 10 years later. like they'd be the type to both pine after each other but maybe one of them is in a relationship and when they break up the other one starts dating someone etc. so they just keep missing their chances. of course they still see each other all the time and I think they'd be like 'oh we're just really really good friends' but under it all they're in love with each other. then finally when the timing IS right they'd get together



skillshare: hate to say it but I think tae would still be pining. I feel like jk doesn't realize his feelings for tae until much much later in their story (would argue he doesn't even HAVE feelings for tae at first) and I don't know that tae would confess without the push of jk doing it first



dna: pining extravaganza I fear

agreed that it only works if you saw the first but I would argue that's the point (since it's lit. called part 2). they split the book in half so you need the context of the first and all its setup to have all the climax and resolution of the second. idk are people going to see part 2 without seeing part 1?



also I'm biased bc dune is one of my favorite books of all time so as a book reader I really liked the movies, I love the way the world looked and the character design, I agree the romance was kinda bland but tbh the romance is even more bland in the book so I wasn't expecting anything life changing. idk I have all the added context of the book on my side so anything that might've fallen flat I think my brain probably just filled in the gaps. but for sure dune (book and movie) are not for everyone so I don't think you should get cancelled over your opinion lol","05 Mar, 2024",set(),1347740185,

I think Dune and then Dune Messiah are good to read together esp. because the author wrote Dune Messiah in response to people missing the point of the first book and Paul as a character. Dune Messiah's actually my favorite I think (also I don't trust anyone who doesn't like that one...). other than that the books afterwards really do start going off the rails there's a lot of sci fi elements that while the first one DOES have them it's still kinda grounded in reality?

4756,"you’re right and you should say it, like, there are conventions or places where you do buy fandom stuffs but online can we just. keep fan spaces free 💀 not to mention from a legal standpoint it runs big risks for lawsuits which might change attitude towards fanfic as a whole and also create a different weird power dynamic between someone who pays and someone who delivers vs someone doing something they enjoy and an audience for it creates itself","yeah it's something I've already seen start to happen in the community (which tbf, I think is more of an influence of booktok than of people paying for fanfic) where people reading think they have the right to demand things from authors or will leave harsh reviews or ratings and it never used to operate like that? I've talked before about how criticism of fic can be beneficial but ultimately once people start viewing fanfic as 'content' they consume and not as a free gift from an author we lose out on the community that's built around people loving the same media or music or whatever it may be. and then that's how you get people that rip authors' works directly from ao3 and make a profit selling physical copies (most of the time without author permission) which is straight up just stealing. I've seen authors start to pull their works because of things like that","29 Feb, 2024",set(),1347253997,

4751,"From what I’ve seen writers do, they don’t just put an entire fic behind a paywall but early release chapters and post extra content like drabbles or BTS of writings outlines etc and imo that’s totally okay if you can make money out of a skill (which i believe writing is bcos not everyone is good at it or can sell it) then they should because lol the world we’re living in rn isn't easy and any little money helps 🤷🏻‍♀️","Yeah again I don’t think that’s wrong, people deserve to make money from a skill they have if they want to. All I’m trying to say is that it does change the way people interact with fic and the way we view fanfic as a whole. Again it moves away from a free community anyone can participate in and towards a transaction. And in my personal opinion I don’t want fanfic as a concept to be monetized, there’s something to be said about creating art and stories just for the sake of it. I understand not everyone shared that same view and that’s totally fine. Also don’t want to shame other authors for making a profit, my issue is less with authors being rewarded and more that readers who pay to read can start setting expectation's about the content they’re getting and that can bleed into the free community as well","28 Feb, 2024",set(),1347215119,

4749,"You talk like someone from the old-age lol free fanfic is great but there's only so much time someone can give to their hobby. If fanfic can make them the same amount of money as a part time job while studying, then why the hell not? They're doing something they like &  they're getting paid for it & everyone else is happy too ao there is nothing wrong with putting fanfic behind a paywall. If artists can make exclusive art then so can writers. Just like artists, writers don't force anyone to pay them as well, people do it out of their own willingness. Ur take is something i read on reddit in 2013 lol grow with the times :)","When did I say it was wrong? I said legally it’s a gray area and because of that it puts fanfic in jeopardy similar to how all those people that are posting Etsy listings of printed and bound fanfic for people to purchase. That’s fine if you think my take is old and dusty but every hobby doesn’t suddenly have to become grounds for a side hustle. When you introduce money into the equation you’re cutting off a part of the community which is FINE, not everyone has to have access to your work, but it’s just fundamentally not what fanfic was made for.

OMG I LOVE THIS QUESTION.!!! 

. 

. 

- Cy family when jolie was a baby, and jitae getting jealous of her coz she takes so much time of their parents.

- jitae's conversation about changing majors with jungkook. 

- any ot7 moments from early days. Like those early early chapters. 

- taehyung missing jk and visiting jin while jk is in london. 

- taekook just after marriage without babies, you know like Domestic fluff. 

- reunion of all of them after kids. Like milo, jin's girls, jolie, jitae and everyone. 

.

""“Just me,” she finishes. She emphasizes the point with a sweeping gesture up and down. Jungkook personally thinks she looks nice. Plain, but nice. And as someone WHO's go-to move is wearing black, he knows all too well the pain of looking ‘fashionable’.""



""Poor Cheonsa looks mortified, but Jungkook can’t past the ringing in his ears to assure her it’s fine.""

cy tae: laidback but he makes sure to be prepared in advance



noy jk: chronic underpacker, refuses to have more than one bag and most of the time it's a backpack

noy tae: always ends up forgetting something important and has to buy it (phone charger, toothbrush, shampoo, etc.) so he has tons of half-used travel size items in a drawer at his apartment



iylm jk: packs so neatly, makes a checklist for when he leaves and comes back, leaves space for souvenirs 

iylm tae: thank god he's famous and usually has someone else handling his schedule, otherwise he'd probably not even have his passport. is used to getting stranded in places so he's got the eyemask, earplugs, neck pillow, etc. on hand to take a nap



skillshare jk: HATES packing with a passion but runs their travel itinerary like the navy. is pretty easy about delays and hiccups unless his headphones are dead, and then he's a terror to deal with

skillshare tae: chronic overpacker. why is he bringing a 20 oz bottle of lotion and 8 pairs of underwear for a 3 day weekend



dna jk: hasn't traveled much at all so he's generally optimistic about the whole thing. carries all the bags. loves the mini restaurants inside the airport so when they get stranded he's excited to browse around

dna tae: likes peoplewatching. has definitely been invited to look around in the cockpit before



losin end jk: never been on a plane before. not a fan of how crowded the airport is but overall he just sleeps through most of it

losin end tae: dripped out waiting at the gate, brings a stack of books and just works his way through them so he doesn't really care about delays either. if they get stranded he's taking his books over to the airport bar



chingu jk: travels first class so he normally has a good experience. also has no stress bc tae's the one planning everything out ahead of time and he just has to show up

chingu tae: when he does travel with jk he has a 2:1 rule where jk can bother him for 2 hours and then has to leave him along for 1 afterwards","22 Feb, 2024","{'cy', 'noy', 'iylm', 'dna', 'headcanon', 'skillshare', 'chingu', 'le'}",1346552253,

also any mid to upscale restaurant that may have a few locations he's a fan of (think pecora bianca, upland, quality eats, emmy's pizza, the smith, etc.). remember this man is peak finance bro and I fear his tastes do reflect it at times. has been to buddakan at least 600 times with his team and he's TIRED



speaking of buddakan tae loves chelesa market (of course) and he sometimes likes central park if it's not a really crowded day. loves going to the 60th street entrance on the weekends and browsing through the half-off Strand pop-up

cy tae: he's never watched the superbowl and he probably never will. sure it's been on the tv in his general vicinity before but never once has he felt compelled to sit down and watch it (or any football game for that matter)



noy jk: he's watching bc he tae jimin yoongi jin and junghyun have an ultra competitive fantasy football league each year and then they place bets on the superbowl



noy tae: also watching half bc he wants to see if his bets pay off and half for the food at the party bc ari's cooking so he's SAT



iylm jk: jin throws a party every year that he goes to and it always ends up with him sequestered in jin's room with a book



iylm tae: I vaguely remember writing something about hobi getting into football through yoongi's brother when he's helping them in minnesota and makes tae watch the super bowl with him that year. I feel like the two of them would end up in a box actually at the game the next few years but I think tae would only be really invested in the halftime show



skillshare: neither of them give a fuck about american football



dna: jk used to watch it with joon but he hasn't had the time over the last few years to start watching it again. and then tae used to watch it with his dad even though he didn't really care about it, but he hasn't watched it either since his parents moved away. in an alternate universe I can picture them having their friends over for a party and still neither of them would really pay attention to the actual game

for skillshare he's secretly simping every damn day. tae is the simplord supreme but jk's got some simping up his sleeve for sure. he's just not great at showing his true feelings all the time so when tae makes a nice/romantic gesture he pretends to tease him about it or act like it's not giving him 5 million butterflies but it so completely is. tae's a gentleman and jk eats it up even if he pretends not to","19 Feb, 2024","{'skillshare', 'iylm'}",1345540115,

Now I know it takes a lot of work and not even possible to fit in a clock wheel for some like chingu tae who has 70 things to do and chingu  jk who has no idea what's he supposed to do at all, also for cy, timeline issues and all that... 

but, maybe you can do a little headcanon about how their ordinary/relaxing day goes in cc itself? Like our usual headcanons.. (idk if it's already asked lol there are so many headcanons in your cc and they are so fun)","ok cy I think jk has it all down to a science so when he does have a free day there's no overlapping activities he needs to do (unless it's like pick the kids up from practice or something) so he just parks his ass on the couch and stays there from morning to evening (as he should). when tae has a free day he also doesn't plan anything but he'll usually just wake up and see where the day takes him



for noy, I think they both have a fair amount of relaxing days bc their jobs are flexible. they play a lot of video games together and on the days they do make plans it's usually to take a little trip somewhere or to visit with family



iylm they're obviously reading but I also think they like to spend time outdoors (think going on the boat, visiting parks, bike riding, etc) since on work days both of them are cooped up inside doing things most of the time



skillshare tae I'm pretty sure can't relax even if he TRIED he's using his time off to do another one of his million unfinished projects. usually jk will convince him to just sit and watch TV (which is what he does on his relaxing days) and they'll always go on a long walk with Bam in the morning



dna...I don't think these guys really have ordinary days tbh. I think when Tae has a day off he'll spend it with sope or Jimin or otherwise just catch up on sleep. jk absolutely is just crashing facefirst into bed and staying unconscious until the next alarm goes off



losin end - every day is a relaxing day for them LOL and that's on retirement



chingu tae is probably the most typical 'off day' person, he on purpose schedules things like doctors/dentist appointments then so he doesn't have to worry about later, does grocery shopping, laundry, etc. chingu jk is jetting off somewhere with his mom or spending the entire day sucked into a spontaneous project and not leaving his apartment, there's no in between","19 Feb, 2024","{'cy', 'noy', 'iylm', 'dna', 'headcanon', 'skillshare', 'chingu', 'le'}",1344665445,

and then I think he's just slammed with an onslaught of feelings and per usual the only way he can possibly handle them all at once is to cry.

for Tae it was the job opportunity, I think he says somewhere in the fic that he moved from Canada for the position. and then for JK it was more that he wanted a change and this job was able to sponsor his visa and all that so it was more of a convenience thing.

4473,"Hello Ksa ! With Valentine’s Day approaching and me being very extremely single, I have been rereading your fics to make up for lack of love in my life🥹 and I realized that you usually write from jk’s pov like we see his frustrations and pining more (except for iylm)

Anyway, I’ve been therefore wondering if you could share how your tae’s view their jk’s - their most “simp” thoughts 👀 what are they ?","so true idk maybe it's bc I'm a tae bias so I hate giving him any major character flaws LOL so he's not as compelling of a viewpoint as a jk plush I just love gushing about irl and fictional taehyung



cy: jk really occupies like 50% of his brain at all times which is saying a lot given how much his attention strays. but no fr jk is his rock he's the touchpoint for tae's whole life and i think tae more than anyone else knows that and sees how special it is



noy: I mean his most simp thoughts are redacted bc he's canonically a freak in the sheets but other than that he loves jk's resilience and really admires how much he's willing to work on himself - I think tae gives jk a lot of grace when he's dealing with problems and maybe not acting on his best behavior bc tae knows he's on a journey and watching jk reach the endpoint makes him happier than pretty much anything



iylm: he's definitely the one we already know the most, everything in the fic about him finding jk shy and sweet is always true for him everyday - obviously the lisp is a big simp factor but I think also just watching jk as he gets older and lives away from his parents and seeing him flourish into his own person really gets tae in the heart



skillshare: aw come on this is the mayor of simpville he loves everything about his jk. every thought is more simp than the last



dna: simps hard for jk's bod like doc is kind of a secret horn dog. but also he simps for jk's compassion and his dependability (even if he's unpredictable tae knows he'll always come through...ok maybe not after the date fiasco but USUALLY) 



losin end: baby protector. he saw a broke down hobo failing to make an ikea table and he was head over heels. most simp thoughts about his jk are how to give him all the material things he hasn't had in the past and make sure he's well-loved



chingu: not so much simping as genuinely liking jk's quirks and personality which is sadly a rarity in jk's life. I think tae does actually enjoy jk as a person and part of his professional facade is really only an act bc he knows if he indulged jk in anything he'd lose all authority in like 5 seconds","05 Feb, 2024","{'cy', 'noy', 'iylm', 'dna', 'headcanon', 'skillshare', 'chingu', 'le'}",1343635823,

awwww poor tae I love him as a character bc honestly he's pretty grating at times to people and he doesn't realize that until JK is like 'I hate you' bc in his mind he's batting 100 and JK surely likes him back he's just doing some flirty fake angry act. so then when JK gives him a reality check I think he takes more time to be introspective and think about why he comes off as abrasive when he's trying to be sweet. (part of which is def just his personality but I think some of it too is him having a superiority complex wrapped up in a bundle of insecurities but THAT'S a whole other story). when he's being sweet to JK for those moments it's him actively trying to be kinder and softer","28 Jan, 2024","{'skillshare', 'headcanon'}",1344043785,

just had new angst fear unlocked (even tho it's obvious) I wonder if one of the reasons tae won't allow himself to date or get with jk is because he thinks he won't get on with hyunjin

Like I realise hyunjin will be a factor for tae dating anyway but he knows jk very well now and knows he's a decent guy but in terms of having him in his son's life and him specifically 'not liking' hyunjin might be a deterrent for tae even after he accepts his attraction or feelings for jk 😔 

so I wonder if they'll start off as fwb 👀",interestingggggg yeah I think tae has that barrier up with most of his thoughts about dating in general like 'oh what if they don't like my kid' bc then they're obviously not an option. their romance/feelings for each other is something I'm even now still working out lol like I can't full decide who is going to realize first,"28 Jan, 2024",{'chingu'},1344007908,

I wonder if he grew up rich like yugyeom or less privileged ? Anyway this was my long ass ask bc i missed thme and the latest chapter brought me to tears - byeeee xx","I really think they would not have, like atp tae is in the throes of becoming famous and jk is still in the mindset of spider-man being his whole life and responsibility. part of why they work so well together now and they came together so so quickly is bc they're both on the brink of like...total collapse lol. I think maybe if they were both brave enough to let their walls down they could have gotten together, but I think it would take a much, much longer time. 



for tae's upbringing I think he was pretty normal, and that's why moving to new york and finding success at 23 was such a wild thing to experience for him; next chapter we'll get deeper into his backstory too so look out for that 😉





ok tho IF they met before tae got famous...I think maybe that could happen. and then I strongly feel that tae would've never been a famous writer at all, but I do feel if that was the case something about JK actively being spiderman would strain that relationship a lot. so either way if they knew each other when they were younger at any point I think only where they are in their respective lives now is when they would truly click","28 Jan, 2024",{'le'},1343872517,

I hope you are doing well !! Thanku so much showing me the beauty of the selfless , devoted , passionate love that you have portrayed in your fic "" The Calender Year "" , my most favourite fic of all times. So yeah , I love the love that taekook have. The way jungkook is always thinking about his angel "" tae"" , taking care of him , the way he addressed him with so much love, it's just so beautiful . Also, the way tae is always there for him, taking care of his sensitive heart  ...it's just to much for me .  

I had never realised that love like this could exist in real life. But if it does, I wish to have such a love life . Reading there daily life stories make me fall in love with love , they just make me so giddy, mushy , happy but at the same time, it makes me emotional too ...cause it always makes me wonder just how can someone love each other so selflessly, the devotion , the care, the respect , the love , just everything in this fic is so beautiful. I also want to have someone like jungkook in my life who can help me out with my body image issues , sometimes it gets really overwhelming , someone who can just push me to be whoever I want , do whatever I want , no shouting , no disrespect, just love and respect for each other ...ah I read your one reply where you mentioned that jungkook just pours his love in taehyung and through tae it passes to whole world ...just oh my jungkook...how can you love so much...it really makes me cry ....I'm really sorry I am really emotional RN and it's happening for few days now. Earlier reading this fic used to make me happy ..it still does but at the same time it gets me so emotional cause of the amount of love they have for each other.  I think I will take a break from rereading ...cause it's like a treasure for me.. and a hope for me to manifest a love life like them . 



Again, thanku so much Authornim!! 

Stay happy and healthy always 🌸

4384,"KSA you icon... i read chapter 10 of LE... KSA you legend... i'm crying but also very much on the verge of becoming a conspiracy theorist - which is why i'm gonna share my many theories with you - but before that a DISCLAIMER : i am in no way sure if the things i interpreted as hints were actually hints. (i may also think i got it right if you end up not publishing *wink wink*)

So theory no.1 : this is not an extended theory but i always assumed that tae and yugyeom would have known each other, like at least crossed each other in parties since it coincides with when tae became really famous and hanging out with his toxic buddies and yugyeom was dealing with addiction.

Theory no.2 : Even the book preface had this thing about a blue eyed dude and another with vomit on his shirt... like maybe everything in the book is a lie... but like is one of them yugyeom ? or did yugyeom write the book and tae published it since tae asked jk if yugyeom was a writer ??? idkkkkk

Theory no.3 : Regardless of who is in the book or who wrote it... i think that if tae has met yugyeom, he may have seen jk ? bc that one time they talked about spiderman was at that marketplace and tae seemed very empathetic ? 

Theory no.4 : i think tae may know jk is spiderman already. Like... the lack of questions about his scars... his care... it may be more than just unconditional acceptance but something he already expected ? 

Theory no.5 : i saw someone comment on ao3 that tae may turn out to be green goblin... while there is clearly something that tae feels guilty about from his past, i really don't think he fits a super villain persona ? i feel like he would be more like the ex of the villain who ended up helping his villain partner ?

Theory no.6 (also the final one) : i think that even if tae doesn't know jk is spiderman, whatever he did will turn out to be something that hurt jk, and most likely through yugyeom. 

These were all complimentary theories like idk if they seemed kinda repetitive as well but voilà !

4273,"bro i have SO many feelings about dna jk it’s not even funny anymore i need adoption papers idc that he’s older than me. i was thinking and i am emotional about the fact that the plot of the fic existing is proof that he took the first step towards like. « i deserve to exist and have good things » with him quitting his job and while he said he was trying to literally disappear so many years it’s like this is him learning to allow himself to exist again 🥹 and the fact that he goes to get closer to tae for that? poetic cinema,,, BUT also what makes me sad where he’s at right now is that he’s trying to get closer to tae and asking him out and stuffs but doesn’t even dare to think about letting him in? like man do you think you’re gonna start dating and sneak away from your boyfriend to do patrols every night and not tell him where you got bruises like you did for jin,,, im gonna smack him in the face you deserve to be known and loved dumbass","oooo it's interesting that you interpreted his job change like that! I think tbh everyone else in his life does too, like when Jin's talking with Tae at Thanksgiving he mentions that JK has always had a mind for science and he's happy about JK pursuing his passions.



but from JK's eyes I've always seen it as something that happens because of Jin's cancer diagnosis, like that pushes him to change jobs not because he wants better for himself but because he wants to make Jin's life easier and he knows Jin hates him working for the paper.



BUT to your point...I don't think he was expecting Tae, and that's REALLY what's making him want to start existing again 🥲



he really is not thinking with his smart brain at the moment and he certainly doesn't have a game plan about the whole secret identity while having a bf thing. I think he's kept Jungkook and Spider-Man separate for so many years now he's having a hard time remembering he's really only one person and he can only take so much","31 Dec, 2023",{'dna'},1341417021,

4204,"I'm having some reaally stressful and kinda bad days rn and horrible mood swings plus this bts leaving for military news is like cherry on top LOL hehe (using horrible sense of humor by adding LOL, as defense mechanism) so I decided to read cy chapters where tae's father doesn't love him unconditionally and he feels down, like when he doesn't allow tae for paris or when he feels proud of tae only after he get promoted and, you know all that.... 

I totally feel tae and I kinda also understand his father, I mean he's wrong but he's also not wrong about his point of view, that's how real the world works, like if you're not financially stable it's hard to choose the career you like but isn't actually financially very promising and it's not guaranteed that you're gonna succeed in that, and no parent want their child to suffer to meet the ends like they had to, it's also true that if you choose the path which is financially promising and aren't happy then what's the point of having money and stability! It's really hard to find middleground so sometimes lower middle class or even middle class families has to compromise in their choices and learn to be happy, I'm glad that tae got to do something he loves afterall and that also successfully, his father was able to understand afterwards that he didn't love tae unconditionally which he should have, and the most important thing is I'm really happy that jk loves tae without any expectations. He always support him, he really loves him and encourages him when sometimes even tae doesn't love himself, I know it's fiction and I have to appreciate you that you managed to write this whole dynamic so realistically and beautifully.

I really do wish that in real life also every 'cy tae' finds himself a 'cy jk' / manage to be a 'cy jk' for their 'cy tae' ( I know that I'm wishing for impossible thing but what's the harm in wishing.. and also sorry for the rant, you probably didn't even wanna read this stupid long thing which isn't really a question 😅)","don't worry I loved this rant. one of my favorite things about writing these stories is hearing how you guys relate it it, thank you for sharing 💗 sending you love","12 Dec, 2023",{'cy'},1339712858,
4203,"Hii, hope you're doing well. I recently watched Demon Slayer and I'm currently watching Jujutsu Kaisen and i absolutely LOVE THEM. So I'm trying to introduce myself into the anime word. Could you recommend me some animes to start?","ahhhh yessssss



tbh my experience with anime has more depth than breadth so the ones I love I know everything about but there's like 20 million popular ones I haven't watched



if you like demon slayer and jjk I think you should try attack on titan, in my opinion it has one of the best plots in anime like there were countless times my jaw was on the floor and I think the character building is pretty strong. there's a main protagonist but everyone else has more than enough time to shine (it feels similar to jjk in that way)



if you're looking for something somewhat lighthearted/a quick watch I will recommend sk8 the infinity until my dying day it's such a fun show and all the characters are gold. I really like the main character; he's different from the traditional anime protag in that he's almost like the sidekick? so there's a lot of exploration of that and what it means to have a passion for something you might not have the talent for. idk it's a cool concept and then the show is also just funny and wholesome. found family vibes and also it's probably the closest anime I've seeing to being outright gay. the community around the show is really queer and trans positive especially in the fanfic which I think is really cool



moriarty the patriot I will actually never shut the fuck up about I LOVED this show. idk people might find it kinda boring but it's essentially a sherlock holmes retelling with his nemesis moriarty as the main character. (btw they're defintely gay for each other but that's neither here nor there). I would say if you're getting bored of it give it a chance until sherlock shows up bc tbh he made the show for me. I like the spin they did for him since it's a character that's been done a billion times and I think it works really well with moriarty



castlevania is also a great one for complex characters, I love all the main characters and if you like the strong female leads in jjk you'll love sypha she's such a badass and an actual well written woman character which is so refreshing. don't see that a lot in anime so it's really nice to watch. also it's like sexy medieval vampires what more could you ask for



those are my recs, I think out of all of them AOT is the only really 'popular' one, but lmk what you think if you end up watching any of them!","12 Dec, 2023",set(),1340005220,

4188,what are your characters favorite colors and do they have a reason? like dna tae and green (which btw it being the opposite of red Haunts me),"ahhh yes the color wheel strikes again! ok fav colors and why



cy jk: he was a blue lover you might have thought red but I know in my soul he loved blue as a kid. always switched his video game characters to the blue fit and definitely dunked on his friends as blue donkey kong. also anakin's lightsaber was blue all this blue evidence is just mounting up before our eyes

cy tae: green bc he looks best in it. also has just always liked green



noy jk: green (bc tae's eyes have the tiniest flecks of green in them)

noy tae: blue (specifically forget-me-not blue)



ilym jk: black bc it's the absorption of all color so by default he actually loves every color (certified nerd behavior)

iylm tae: I think I also said his fav was green? I'm pretty sure that's what he says when he and JK talk about it. makes him think of nature/outdoors/freedom which he doesn't see a lot of between traveling for work and hospital visits



skillshare jk: any shade of purple. doesn't wear it much but tae makes sure to give him only purple household things to keep at tae's place (toothbrush, mug, towels, etc.) jk only manages to hate it a tiny bit

skillshare tae: orange and not like peeta mellark orange like traffic cone orange bright neon orange. (he and I are soulmates in this regard)



dna jk: a genuine gray enjoyer. I think he's gotten a perspective of how beautiful all that steel and concrete can be after swinging around the city for years. obviously also a red and blue enjoyer, I firmly believe dogwood red is Jin's favorite color and navy blue is Joon's and it was a little dedication to them.

dna tae: green as we know, it also reminds him of nature and when I was doing research about how color affects the brain it's supposed to help with focus and clarity and I think post head trauma that'd be relevant to him. also yes it is the opposite of red and he is haunted by it too



losin end jk: yellow. it makes him feel hopeful

losin end tae: wine red (for exactly the reason you think)



chingu jk: he's a pastel man at heart. think of any sanrio character and he probably loves that color palette.

chingu tae: electric blue he may or may not have had a guitar in a similar color back in the day...","05 Dec, 2023","{'cy', 'noy', 'iylm', 'dna', 'headcanon', 'skillshare', 'chingu', 'le'}",1338154961,

If i was in his situation I'd be insane too. He saved those little girls. He always has that gentle smile and he's so mother 😭😭. He was told there were 2 and he chose one. As for killing his parents i think they weren't good bc geto cared about his friends and his found family. He was even asking about them in his last moments and even after kenjaku corrupted his body hearing suguro hos body reacted on his own on instinct to protect gojo. Broo he wasn't even that worse. Jjk corp and gojo let him roam around freely and let him do anything he wanted for 10-12 years until he declared war himself.

4115,Which of your characters will get along with which anime character?,"ok based of what I said before about which animes I would drop them in



cy in Bleach - these two are BEST FUCKING PALS with Shunsui and Jushiro like actually JK is inviting them over for beers and to watch the game and they're all commiserating about the young generations



noy in AOT - JK is either Eren's bff or they're duking it out there's no in between. I think Tae would get along with Levi surprisingly well, I feel like he'd manage to charm him enough. they'd bond over liking tea

 

iylm in Bungo Stray Dogs - JK and Atsushi were meant to be best friends. Tae would find Dazai fun for a little bit but he'd really get along best with Junichiro



skillshare in JJK: once JK sees Megumi's demon dogs  it's over; they'd hit it off really well despite not saying much. meanwhile Tae and Gojo are in a yap-off and it's not going to end any time soon



dna in Cowboy Bebop: JK and Spike would get along esp, with the tortured past and all while Tae is fascinated by Ed's computer skills



losin end in Castlevania: I said they would be a vampire hunter x vampire pairing so it can only be JK getting along with Trevor and Tae bonding with Alucard (and I think he and Sypha would actually hit it off so well too)



chingu in Sk8: JK would like Adam for about 0.2 seconds before realizing he's WEIRD, would actually get along with Reki and Langa. Tae is basically a Cherry Blossom insert so of course they're going to get along. and if Cherry's there you know Joe isn't far behind so I think he'd make JK feel at ease","13 Nov, 2023","{'cy', 'noy', 'iylm', 'dna', 'headcanon', 'skillshare', 'chingu', 'le'}",1337277647,
4114,"can you give us a headcanon of the most romantic thing CY taekook did for each other (that it isn’t necessarily ‘loud’ but still very sweet and something they couldn’t ever forget because of how sweet it was)? it can be from any era of their relationship, i just miss them sm 😊🥺","I feel like their really big romantic gestures we've seen in the fic, but here's some little sweet things they've done for each other



for years and years jungkook stops to take pictures of mannequins in store windows wearing outfits he thinks tae would like



jungkook doesn't know it but when tae goes by himself to used bookstores he spends half his time looking through the manga/comics section to see if he can find something jungkook's been looking for","13 Nov, 2023","{'headcanon', 'cy'}",1337318895,

4111,"just out of curiosity, do you have any writing tips or techniques to actually plot/outline fics? i feel like i always love finding concept ideas and then when it comes to fleshing it out and saying what happens scenes but scenes i struggle sm to make it concrete 😔😔","hmmmm I mean my process is usually the concept, and then I always come up with the ending point first. like where are we trying to get to with the story. and then if there are any specific scenes/plot points I definitely want to happen, I add those in, and then from there it's a matter of connecting everything. tbh I don't get too in depth with outlines, I usually just have them so I know the general direction I need to take. but I also don't write in order so I don't rely too much on an outline anyway. idk if that was helpful at alllll lol","13 Nov, 2023",set(),1337386853,
4110,"https://curiouscat.live/kicksomeacid/post/1337017910 hey, yes you're absolutely right, like this feels more private, I mean there are some people on Twitter who just likes to weird out others by any means since a tweet is like open for world, but this space feels somewhat safe and like even if it wasn't anonymous one can ask about anything without worrying about unnecessary people coming for them, cause they have to be invested in any/all of your stories to be coming here, anonymous is just added bonus like not everyone feels okay enough to share what are their thoughts about certain things to the people who have no context about that thing whatsoever publicly, and also it's your choice who you want to reply so you can easily filter out those trolls and harmful comments... 

as far as liking you as a writer, as an old reader I would like to share that it is absolutely about your witty writing girl, you answer each question very thoughtfully and those headcannos are the best part of it, it just feels like ksaverse thing, I haven't came across any other writer and reader space like this one, many writers have curious cat but I feel most this is most fun, like a daily newspaper or therapy session with ksaverse's characters and a bits about you and us in between (maybe I'm not aware if anyone does that 😅) like it keeps us engaged and satisfied about what's going on in our favorite character's life, what are their quirks, etc.. it feels lively even if the fic is not updated for a while or already finished.. And I also would like to think that although being anonymous you could tell by some of the questions like yeah this pattern is same as some previous ones.. So like this is my regular reader...

just ranted a lot LOL but wanted to convey this.. Hope it makes sense hehe😅💜.

(P. S. - ALSO WHEN YOU FINISH YOUR ONGOING FICS WE HAVE TO GO BACK AND GET ALL ANSWERS IN HEADCANNONS WHERE YOU'VE WRITTEN THIS CONTENT HASN'T BEEN UNLOCKED YET... 😤)","yeah I feel like once I started using curiouscat I had a lot more interaction with readers bc you do have the option to be anonymous, which I totally get. like I'm kind of anonymous too online so I like being in a space where everyone can enjoy the community without having to worry about using their twt accounts or showing their handles. 



thank you for complimenting my wit LOL I'm currently trying to funnel it all into Losin End Tae and YES daily newspaper is the best thing anyone's said about me doing all these answers



some of the questions I can figure out but not always. I can def tell if someone regularly keeps up with my stuff or not, but it's hard to know if it's the same person unless they reference an earlier ask or something

excited for a gc tho but that’s cause i need to scream with those who felt the same pain","yesss this is also what I was trying to say, I like that when I respond to stuff here or link it in a tweet everyone can be a part of the convo together. and if someone was to scroll down my answers it's more open than going into a bunch of little comment threads on twt. and yes group chat is live! if you aren't already in it you can send me your twt handle and I'll add you","13 Nov, 2023","{'dna', 'chingu'}",1337242974,

Here feels like a safe space where we can talk about these fictional characters whose stories have brought us a lot of joy. And thank you KSA for providing this space and interacting with us so much here. Even when I feel some of my questions are stupid, you always answer it with such wit. I truly miss the banter when this app acts up !🤣","yes this is what I think I was trying to say, I like giving people the freedom to talk with me on here and it just adds a layer of privacy to stuff. and for me as well, like I don't want to accidentally get dragged on twt for talking about ships that personally I view as just a goofy bit of fictional fun. it just keeps things easy and nice and yes this app is FUN I live for all the questions, stupid or not","13 Nov, 2023",{'cy'},1337237575,

As he said , he is right. He is a not-so-smart (stupid) person who had a lot of power. A raging child chasing freedom. A slave to freedom. Can't change his nature. He is, in my eyes, a child throwing a temper tantrum at the way he was treated. You are right on the point armin would be able to get more people on his side whatever the decision he takes on this.

dna: Cowboy Bebop first off I hc'd it as dna tae's favorite anime and second dna tae in SPACE??? with jk as his gun totting bounty hunter friend/lover by his side as he explores all the different planets? they'd fit this vibe so well.

I feel weird retweeting if someone recommends my fic or replying if someone says something nice about an update since everyone on twt can see that. it's just my preference, obviously there's nothing at all wrong with doing that. but to me idk I just prefer to be more active here on cc. it's still open for people to see/read but it's another layer of privacy for me and people that like my stuff to interact with. curious to hear my readers opinions too on it though","09 Nov, 2023",{'cy'},1337017910,

4002,"hey have you read the guardians review about golden . honestly that critique is so disrespectful and has given less critique on the album and more on unnecessary things specially regarding bts. When he mentioned about groups splitting when a member goes solo , I was ready to throw hands . BTS have said thousands times that they are not disbanding and cant wait for 2025.  Also i dont even know why he was bringing bts carles jung inspiration thing into golden review . like when you're reviewing an album why are you bringing an album that had completely different direction and concept. 

Also kpop artists usually dont accept/ bring into conversation how the trainee system is kind of like military training and not real artistary but when bts were honest about it in festa video , this guy brings it into golden review (which is like what sir, what business does that has here)  and kind of puts it into a bad light.  

I think someone should give review about this critiques skills.

- skillshare jk has gotten an eyebrow piercing before but he'll have to get it redone since it closed

- dna also no piercings, it's just too bothersome to deal with

- losin end tae we covered, I think jk would get something like a belly button piercing or a nose piercing just bc tae wants him to and he's indulging him. for sure forgets about it though so it closes up

- chingu jk would get his tongue pierced and definitely his lip, would dabble in eyebrow piercings and he's for sure got a bunch of holes in his ears. chingu tae has his ears pierced but he hasn't actually worn earrings in like five years and there may or may not be photo evidence of him having snake bites at one point in his twenties","03 Nov, 2023","{'cy', 'noy', 'iylm', 'dna', 'headcanon', 'skillshare', 'chingu', 'le'}",1336679254,

dna tae is confused and miserable about getting stood up and obviously doesn’t hear from jk again and that lasts a day maybe two during which he does not see spider man either despite the fact that he was kinda supposed to idrk and anyway late the evening after or two evenings after jin calls him (he has his number somehow) asks like yo has jk been with you this whole time bc when he didn’t come home i just assumed your date went well but i haven’t heard from him in two days and i’m starting to be? confused/worried? to which tae tells him he stood him up and jin is now very worried and confirms to him what he already thought which is that it would take a nuclear apocalypse for jk to miss that date and tae tells him he’s been fired and jin hasn’t seen him since and tae is worried too now



when he hangs up he does make the connection that both he and spiderman disappeared at the same time, and the ‘coworker’ thing (jk you clown) already had him weirded out recently. i feel like at this point he has all the elements and just needs a nudge in the right direction to figure it out: the wounds he saw when he stayed over, same build, not talking to him as spidey, etc. bonus point i totally hc him as having a shoebox with spiderman mementos in his closet, maybe he compares the letters you mentioned on cc with jk’s current handwriting, maybe he has a pic of him with his mask half off, etc anyway it is in fact all coming together



i feel like he can also put together something about what happened based on that, bc he got fired by sims who was experimenting on freaky blood (and he knows firsthand from healing him that jk has some properties humans don’t have) and irrationally hates jk, who absolutely froze when he saw said blood

im assuming the woman on sims desk is one of the people who abducted jk the first time around and they took off his mask so maybe sims knows jk is spiderman (tho i feel like he might’ve started being a dick to him before so maybe he’s just a dick idk idk) and that he got him fired bc jk was gonna figure it out when he saw the slide results

and labcorp definitely did something to jk cause i really feel like he would lie naked on hot coals before missing a date with tae



im just confused about the « jungkook’s changed » at the end of the chapter like is he referring to high school??? or did i forget jk standing him up in the present??

HOWEVER since then i read the last chapter and. i take it back this shit is harrowing i need to hug them let me hug them please PLEASE",Last chapter hits different fr I was dancing around their pasts in the first 8 chps on purpose so it hits you in the face when they have to start reckoning with it,"26 Oct, 2023",set(),1336040697,

3873,"i meant to ask i think it’s interesting how dna jk himself seems to sort of compartmentalize his two identities as two different persons, like, first of course the thing with wanting tae to choose jk over spiderman which. makes a lot of sense but is sad to me bc i feel like following that logic he thinks tae loves spiderman for like maybe not fame but definitely the Excitment and Special-ness (? damn i have such a way with words) that comes with the superhero and wouldn’t love plain boring jk whereas i really do feel like while that played in the initial fascination he had for him he really fell for him like, hanging out together and getting to know him and ultimately something he could’ve had with jungkook too if he let himself get close. but also the way he breaks down the first time he sees tae again as spider-man and lets himself process the guilt he felt as if it was the first time he saw him again when he’s been seeing him for months without the mask. and the way when they meet again it sort of feels like we see jk develop a crush again but also he’s obviously loved tae this whole time. just realized i said ask but this isn’t really a question so it’s more like yay complex character moment and what are your thoughts on that

also maybe question. will the fic end around the time they figure it out and get together identity revealed or will we get some moments with established relationship them. if you can/want to answer that. 👀",yes we talked about this on retrospring but this is such a good analysis!!!!! love the way you interpret his character that's like exactly how I think about him too,"25 Oct, 2023",{'dna'},1335813968,

3858,headcanons for skincare routines lol!! whose routine has the most steps? who uses 8-in-1 shampoo/conditioner/toothpaste/etc. yet still has the clearest skin ever? i'd imagine IYLM tae has a pretty vigorous routine just for like ∼model∼ reasons but does does anybody else?,"cy jk: was for sure the 8-in-1 guy in college but after he goes to London and breaks out a bunch he gets a better routine from tae--cleanser, toner, moisturizer with spf, charcoal mask once a week

cy tae: he's been using the same face wash/moisturizer drug store brand since tenth grade and it's never steered him wrong. tried a more expensive version once he was older but it didn't hit like the og so he went right back



noy jk: unfortunately he is an 8-in-1 user the only thing he takes super seriously is dental hygiene bc of Jin

noy tae: nothing fancy but he loves to do a skincare night now and again. more interested in using different colognes from day to day



iylm jk: neutrogena poster boy any product that says 'ance' on it he's tried. uses that exfoliating scrub a lot

iylm tae: you're right that he has a intense routine but it's less day-to-day and more like he has monthly appointments set up by his modeling agency to get his eyebrows threaded or have a facial. otherwise it's fairly normal other than all his products costing like $100 dollars each



skillshare jk: given that he's an oily skin king (such as myself) he's pretty vigilant with a routine. slacks off sometimes when he's busy with work but usually does the same three step routine morning and night

skillshare tae: this man can hardly brush his hair correctly jk comes in with a VENGANCE. definitely makes them do couple face mask nights. somehow tae almost always has perfect skin even though he washes with BAR SOAP and it irritates JK to no end



dna jk: what is skincare. 

dna tae: pretty normal and I also know he would be DEDICATED when it comes to UV protection he's got spf in his moisturizer you can bet on it



losin end jk: I know with ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY this man used Irish Spring for most of his adult life. king of mixing his body wash/shampoo with water to make it last longer

losin end tae: icon with an agenda to age gracefully he's got that cabinet STOCKED. more than willing to share with jk of course. uses those 24k gold undereye patches religiously and you know what they work

3856,What would be their reaction to each other having now-friends-former-exes/flings? (if we pretend they all had exes) (don't hv to answer if it's too much of a reach <3),"cy jk: jealous to the max of course but I think if it was after they were engaged/married he'd be more mellow about it

cy tae: makes friends with them too, unbothered



noy jk: kinda irks him but also he's not going to ruin his sweet angel baby's friendship if that's what he wants. obviously if it comes out that they hurt tae in any way when they were together jk is serving them bodily harm

noy tae: also not a very jealous person, I think he'd end up better friends with them than jk lol



iylm jk: insecure at first but tbh I feel like if tae had an ex they'd match his social energy a lot and they'd make jk really comfortable

iylm tae: jealous mf he wants ken dead on sight but he'll act nice on the surface



skillshare jk: similar to iylm tae he's jealous on the inside but he also just has to get used to it bc out of all my characters skillshare tae seems like the most likely to stay friends with all his exes

skillshare tae: gets in on their plan to tease jk for being so moody in the past



dna jk: not really much he can do about that lol so he just kinda hangs. though if the former fling in question is spider-man he will maybe drop some not so subtly comments about how spider-man probably doesn't shower

dna tae: poor babe it's a dagger in the heart at first but he learns to live with it. would never be outwardly mean or jealous



losin end jk: as long as they aren't lev or felix or chen or any of tae's current friends he's fine with them

losin end tae: duel to the death for the right to jk's hand (which is really just inviting them for drinks) definitely will give them a grilling about wtf they've been doing for all this time since jk was on his own so much

I do think Jungkook probably makes an off handed comment that’s self deprecating about how Joon didn’t approve of him and Tae makes him explain and decides it needs to be addressed. I can see him forcing Joon and JK to sit down together and “talk it out” (even though by this point it’s like months to a year later) and Joon apologizes for making jk think it’s him that Joon didn’t trust (bc as we and now Joon knows it had nothing to do with Jungkook or his trustworthiness was at all),"11 Oct, 2023",{'iylm'},1335567752,

Or like when he disappeared after the wedding and refused to come back home?",Oof I think it’s really hard for him especially bc he’s such an empathetic person. Like all those memes “I’m an empath” yeah he’s actually one. I think with JK too it’s really hard bc that’s his person and to him JK sets the stars in the sky so learning that someone treated him poorly or saw him as less than breaks his fucking heart so much. I think there’s some glimpses of it through the fic and I feel like part of his big standoff with his family is part him standing up for himself and part getting out a lot of that anger he feels towards people who hurt jk. Not being able to help is one of Tae’s biggest nightmares so when jk disappears after the wedding he’s rightfully a huge mess about it. But I think even with his inner turmoil at the end of the day his main priority is jk and his mental health so he keeps a lot of those emotions private.

noy is funny bc I actually meant to write it as a ceo jk/perfume counter worker tae with jk having a blind mom he would buy the perfume for to cheer her up when he was away. I like that soft tae/angry jk dynamic that a lot of taekook fics so I wanted to write it, but I decided I wanted to make it different from other stuff and ended up flipping it so jk was the one working at the perfume counter. that's where the whole creepy boss thing came in and then tae with his grandmother etc. and it all spiraled from there. it definitely came out a lot more realistic/human than I had planned at the start, but I love it. that jk in particular is one of my favorites, I feel really protective of him more than maybe any of my other characters :(","08 Oct, 2023","{'noy', 'cy'}",1335145893,

usually when I come up with an idea I'll bullet out the general plot. normally my ideas start from one or two major plot points/scenes and I almost always have an idea for the ending. then I'll try to break the plot into chaptered sections, and after that it's really just what strikes my fancy to write. usually I'll write the stuff I'm excited to write first, so that's how I always end up with like 5 scenes of one chapter and then 20 of something that happens way later in the fic.

THEN he soft-launches JK after he moves to London, but like you can't see his face or any discernable features. I feel like since JK doesn't live on campus or anything it's easier for them to see each other without people putting together who JK is and who Tae is, and since they're both really busy up until JK graduates I think they manage to keep it pretty private. JK is a private person anyway so I think the friends he introduces Tae to are respectful and keep it quiet (even his tae-obsessed roommate).



Tae would probably hard launch JK only after he's graduated and like out living his own life. also with them moving in together + JK traveling around with for a few months post-graduation he figures it's easier to just tell people outright. idk I feel like JK doesn't end up getting body guards I don't think I have Tae using them in the fic at any point (which is maybe unrealistic but WHATEVER).

3774,okay… this doesn’t have to do with your writing but.. who would you say are you too 5 or 10 fave authors? Or who are the ones that have impacted your writing the most? They could be fave books too,"I LOVEEEE talking about books!!! I have to warn you my taste is kinda specific and I think most people probably wouldn't enjoy the stuff I do LOL



Gabriel Garcia Marquez/any Latin American magical realism author, magical realism is my FAVORITE type of fiction. I was a Spanish minor in college and found a lot of fascinating stuff. One Hundred Years of Solitude is definitely worth the hype (idk if there is hype around it now? I feel like I saw it on tiktok recently)



William Gibson - I LOVE THIS MAN he wrote Neuromancer which is the book they loosely based The Matrix off of. this is one of the ones I don't think a lot of people would like. really heavy on science fiction and he has this habit of just saying some thing that doesn't exist in reality and never explains it? so at times it's more just vibes but god do I love the vibes. I'd recommend The Peripheral it's one of his more recent ones and I think the plot is clearer to dig into if you aren't a super science fiction-y person



I'm insufferable so of course I like David Foster Wallace, I genuinely liked Infinite Jest though I'm not sure I'd read it again. if I do I'll skip a lot of the footnotes lol



This Is How You Lose The Time War!! my biggest flex is that I read this book in 2019! I remember being at my hometown library which has like approximately 12 books in the YA section and I picked it up and loved it. was surprised to see it have a resurgence but it for sure deserves it - 'my dearest blue' yeah ok I'm crying.



I really like the John Dies At The End series, more sci-fi but it's basically these two loser guys who accidently are able to see monsters/curses that are haunting the world and do their best to save people. it's super funny and irreverent and stupid but there's also some really genuine moments and plot points with stuff like depression that touched me beyond them hitting evil space maggots with baseball bats



also I've never seen anyone talk about this series before but it's, take a guess, more science fiction it's called Zebulon Finch and it's about this teen that gets killed at the start of the 1900s and basically is doomed to live on until his body just decomposes and it takes you all through the 20th century and his journey and I cried my eyes out at the end. I also emailed the author because I loved it so much and he replied! he was super nice so everyone should read his books 



some other random favorites: Anna Karenina (I read this any time I go to the beach), Dune obviously, The Princess Bride (this should be required reading FR), If on a winter's night a traveler (if you love reading READ THIS), I really love It (there's a lot of Steven King I enjoy but most of it's very similar) but I think the Shining/Doctor Sleep duology is good too, The Westing Game (this is a children's novel but the GRIP it had on me it's a fundamental part of my childhood) there are so many more but I'm running out of space","04 Oct, 2023",{'le'},1334729586,

3761,headcanon for how all your tk's are like as dads since we only got to see cy be parents pls pls pls,"ok fun so here's what I think



noy: I said in a different ask that noy jk would be the biggest pushover dad EVER. I think at the start he'd be really nervous bc of all the shit with his mom but he'd turn out just fine. I feel like Tae is that dad every kid loves and wants to be their group chaperone on field trips and stuff. they would have the cutest chubby kids bc you know JK's whipping up feasts every night for his family



iylm: these two are interesting to imagine bc they're still relatively young in their storyline, I kinda imagine them adopting kids with health problems since Tae can really relate. I think they'd also be really active in children's charities and stuff, definitely want to nurture that inner child since their own childhoods were so rocky



skillshare: it's CHAOS jungkook is constantly conscripting the children onto his side of the war and teaming up on Taehyung when he gets home from work. I feel like they'd have super funny kids and they'd be very jungkook-like when it comes to showing affection so Tae's the odd one out. but for sure they all smother him with love every few weeks to make up for teasing him and he wouldn't have it any other way



dna & losin end: I don't think they'd be parents tbh, for dna I think Tae's happy with his work and obviously JK's busy being spider-man and all. idk I think even when they're older they just wouldn't feel the need to have kids. same with losin end, I think they're both over that want if it was ever there. I do see them helping out at a local center or something and interacting with kids there, but I don't think they have any of their own



chingu: tae we already know, jk I don't want to say because we may see some of his parenting 'skills' in the future","03 Oct, 2023","{'cy', 'noy', 'iylm', 'dna', 'headcanon', 'skillshare', 'chingu', 'le'}",1334788759,

cy tae: he doesn't look outwardly scared but his heart definitely speeds up a lot. not his favorite thing to do but he endures it at least once in the halloween season for jk's sake



noy jk: ""no I didn't scream that was the zombie not me I have a tattoo sleeve""

noy tae: gets scared but loves it anyway, definitely walks through most of it peeking through his fingers even though the whole reason he wanted to go was to see all the decorations



iylm jk: he's a big flincher but he doesn't really scream. it's not his first choice but he'll do it for tae as long as they can hold hands the whole time

iylm tae: goes to one for the first time after he gets his pacemaker and LOVES it. screams so loud and has so much fun the staff gives him a free ticket to come back

iylm jin: he's constantly gasping with a hand over his heart he's not making it out of there without a spike or two of his blood pressure

iylm joon: only goes bc taehyung wants too, actually gets more startled from Taehyung screaming than the actual scares

iylm jimin: screams alongside tae they're besties and they will go look up close at the 

iylm yoongi: one of the performers touches his arm and he smacks the shit out of their hand. does scream but only at the one thing in the house that's not scary at all he's just not expecting it

iylm hobi: refuses to enter the house



skillshare jk: live laugh love haunted houses he will always want to do something like that and have the time of his life. laughs at all the jump scares

skillshare tae: scares easily, he's somehow always the guy that gets picked if they need like a 'victim' or something on a haunted hay ride it's wild how bad his luck is with stuff like that



dna jk: he's too hard to scare bc of his spidey sense, mostly he just admires all the decorations and costumes

dna tae: prefers to dominate a corn maze, he solves them in like 20 minutes



losin end jk: the one time he went by himself he was so quiet and unassuming walking through the performers didn't even register they should jump out and scare him so he had kind of a lame experience

losin end tae: is one of the haunted house performers

also did young teen dna jk already have a crush on taehyung before the two started interacting or did he only start liking him after they started talking (with him being spiderman)?","I think it's not really a romantic crush as much as like a friend crush? like he notices Tae always has a lot of friends around and he's a really nice person to be around, so I think pre-spiderman he still is kinda fixated on Tae because he wishes they were friends but he's always too shy to make the first move. and then of course by the time Tae starts to reciprocate they've already met with jk as spider-man and he's been pushing people away after joon died anyway","30 Sep, 2023","{'dna', 'cy'}",1334634098,

noy jk: that's a philly boy born and raised

noy tae: MY BALTIMORE KING if any of my characters were to have that glorious accent it would be him



iylm jk and jin I can just picture having the slightest Nantucket/new England: drawl like think donna tartt they have hints of that in there



iylm joon and hobi: I think where jk and jin are more polished new England these two are closer to a true Bostonian



iylm yoongi: if you've met anyone from Minnesota you know exactly what they sound like and he also sounds exactly like that



iylm jimin and tae: these two are funny bc I feel like living abroad for so long would really smooth out any specifics. I think Jimin had a touch of that west coast vocal fry in his voice but it really disappears in Italy and same with tae's Massachusetts accent. so they kinda have that generic American but also vaguely European vibe? like the way they pronounce certain words makes you do a double take

skillshare tae: hits that Canadian pronunciation HARD



dna: these are Queens boys baby they've got the accent to prove it. I feel like it's only really noticeable when they're tired or back at home

We got NOY say it in the fic, but with CY, tae saying i love you was the last line of a chapter if i remember correctly, and same with if you love me and skillshare where jk's i love you ended the fic. So, especially for CY jk, skillshare tae and iylm tae, what do they feel/think when they hear their partner say i love you back to them, how do they react?","cy jk: melting melting MELTING. Tae not saying 'I love you' back yet was like one of the first times in his life he wanted something so badly that he couldn't do anything himself to get. so as much as he's squealing on the inside I think he's also really grateful to Tae for taking the plunge even though he knows it's kind of scary. bc it's the thing he wants most in the world at that point and he couldn't do anything but hope Tae decided to give it to him at some point. idk just very sweet and thankful thoughts on his part



skillshare tae: oh he's seconds from crying. he's definitely someone with a lot of internal dialogue and he stresses over things that or out of his control. I think his decision to tell JK 'I love you' is actually spur of the moment and not at all part of his meticulous plan and it kind of throws him. so hearing JK say it back is most of all a relief, especially since JK disliked him so much at the start. 



iylm tae: he's really giddy about it bc it just doesn't even feel real, I think they're so good at making their own little bubble of happiness and tae especially never wants to take any moment for granted. I think it's a fond memory he comes back to a lot and he feels like it's the perfect end to their first time (and his first time ever)","30 Sep, 2023","{'cy', 'noy', 'iylm', 'headcanon', 'skillshare'}",1334144851,

like i don’t think jack’s verses are like jail worthy yk they’re just icky and not even good to make up for it i definitely think people are allowed to be critical over it and i get that it makes people uncomfortable 🤷🏻‍♀️  the whole thing with the girls being interchangeable and collectibles idk it’s weird we don’t have to bring everything back for the retro nostalgia even the objectification hfkfj

and clearly you can have explicit lyrics that aren’t like that bc jk’s verses aren’t so yeah idk i wish stuffs like that wasn’t on his song and i know it’s his choice but people can still. point it out without being hypocrites 😭 you can love him and not agree with everything","that's fair enough I agree that people can make critiques; a lot of my moots don't like the song/verse and they're making good points about it. I also think his lyrics are kinda ick but like I said to me they fit in not even with the early 2000s but with a lot of american rap that's still being made today. and yet that's what's frustrating bc I think a lot of the critiques are only looking at the lyrics with an immediate reaction instead of understanding what he's actually saying. which is why I mentioned it seems like people do not understand/aren't critically engaging with the flow and wordplay. the first verse yes is about him being a misogynist player but then the second verse is about him being with one girl and changing his ways. so I don't think it's like glorifying that behavior if you're understanding the flow (him saying 'four girls, now you're whoring' like he's calling himself a whore not the women. calling himself out on his own behavior of treating women as interchangeable like you said.) people are focused on the literal interpretation of what he said instead (i.e. hearing 'four girls...whoring') and thinking he's calling women whores. I can understand people not liking the crude language but I haven't seen a ton of takes that break down his lyrics the way they're supposed to be heard. so that's what gives me pause about the discourse bc i don't think it's coming from an educated place (from some people.) that being said if you don't like it you don't like it and that's fine. that's the reason a lot of people don't listen to rap in the first place bc they can't get over how explicit it can be, and I understand that.



what I meant referencing War of Hormone was not to say bts is misogynistic bc to your point I think they've learned and grown a lot. I just mean to me it seems weird when people will not want to listen to this because of misogynistic lyrics when lots of songs are similar (at least in the US). I feel like that rhetoric is common in pop music so I find it hard to believe someone who doesn't want to this doesn't regularly listen or engage with similar music (but maybe they don't!) I just know personally it's not something that caught me super off-guard. not a really high standard I guess but there's so many other songs that are so much worse and my point was that even one of bts' songs is similar. idk not to like, excuse misogyny in this modern age. I just feel like at the end of the day it's only a song, yk. listen or not, everyone has their own choice. I just wish more people were open-minded and took time to dig into the intent behind the lyrics (this is why I said it felt similar to the bad religion situation) before they made a decision. again you can have whatever opinion you want, this is just mine and I'm not gonna push it on anyone (which is why I'm just gonna keep it all here on cc lol). hope I explained myself better and thank you for sending this ask, I feel like this is a good open discussion to have","29 Sep, 2023",set(),1334592557,
3692,Headcanon question for you KSA -- taekook are great singers in real life but are your taekooks good singers in your books as well? (yes for NOY Tae but probably not for skillshare tae lmao) bonus points if you could also list their reactions to hearing the other one sing for the first time,"ooo I love this one



cy: both are good singers, I remember writing in one of the chapters that Tae sings to the kids when they're little



noy: Tae has the voice of an angel and JK cannot carry a tune in a bucket. the first time Tae begs for them to do karaoke together is also the last.



iylm: very normal, like they can sing along to the radio fine. oddly enough I think tae would be a very good rapper



skillshare: okay contrary to your assumption Tae actually has a GREAT voice, but he's the kind of guy that sings like too well, you  know? like on a road trip he's doing the harmonies and hitting the runs when they're all supposed to just be belting it out and having a good time. JK is one such guy but he lets Tae sing his heart out if it's just the two of them



dna: neither can really sing, I think they're too left-brained to really care or notice anything like that. though I do believe JK is a music lover my hc is that he wears earbuds under the mask when he's patrolling a lot of the time. he's always got something playing if he's by himself



losin end: I think Tae can carry a tune, and I firmly believe JK has an amazing voice but even he doesn't know that bc he really hasn't had many occasions to sing



chingu: JK is alarmingly good at high notes bc in college he and his roommate would go to karaoke and sing all their favorite gg songs; Tae isn't a singer but he is musically gifted","29 Sep, 2023","{'cy', 'noy', 'iylm', 'dna', 'headcanon', 'skillshare', 'chingu', 'le'}",1334571433,

I love the song it's such a bop. I kinda agree that jack's flow is a little shit, like it just did not click as well as the rest of the song. which they kept more of the instrumental going during his parts bc I think that'd help him along more than just the beat. all his adlibs had me dead though 'spy kids' is for sure my favorite","29 Sep, 2023","{'noy', 'cy'}",1334523369,
3683,How do you like jack’s rap on 3d? I don’t mind the lyrics that much but i feel like his flow is awful :/,"I kinda feel the same, the flow just seemed more stilted and halted the momentum of the song. I wish they'd kept more of the instrumental going during his parts instead of just the beat, I think that's what killed it bc I agree his flow was not enough to carry it alone. I didn't mind the lyrics either but I can see why some people did



what I'm seeing most in all this discourse is that a lot of bts stans apparently don't listen to r&b or rap outside the korean/k-pop genre. maybe it's just because I'm american but those lyrics didn't phase me at all; everything tracked with what american rap/r&b/hiphop is. there's a whole world of lyrics and wordplay that are key to rap music and I feel like a lot of the stans who hate the song just don't understand the genre. completely fine if you don't like it but it almost feels like the bad religion thing all over again where people are taking lyrics very literally and not understanding the message and history behind it. also of course this isn't going to sound like a joon or yoongi or hobi rap like it's jack fucking harlow. he's a very specific type of american rapper and I'm not at all surprised his verse or the rest of the song sounds like it does.



idk I also think we've known since seven that JK is looking to target the western market and I think he's done that perfectly. similar to every other one of the boys solo projects they're doing it for THEMSELVES actually, not for the fans. like this is what HE wants to do and if you don't support it you can keep that info to a small group of people you trust. I think a lot of people are upset he's not making music specifically for fans of bts. but even then 'fans of bts' apparently only means songs like take two or my you or permission to dance or magic shop. like if you listen to bts discography and actually look at the lyrics on some of them they're mad sexual and also ARE WE FORGETTING WAR OF HORMONE?? there's been discourse for years about that song being misogynistic and we're all still shaking ass to it so like...huh?



idk if any of this makes sense and you definitely did not ask. but here's the bottom line:

1. if you don't like jack's part and prefer the alternate version, that's fine. totally entitled to not like a song bc you don't like the lyrics, BUT I don't think you get to twist the narrative just because your specific image of bts and jungkook is being challenged.

2. if you don't like 3D bc of the misogyny delete war of hormone from your playlists lol","29 Sep, 2023",set(),1334557287,

I just think the jks would have the funniest beef ever solely because the other ALSO has a tae. that and I think cy tae could benefit a lot from noy tae's outlook on life and esp everything with his self-esteem issues I just think they'd bond well while the jks are duking it out in the back



cy and iylm:

this is the one that I think gets suggested the most, the classic pairing of cy tae directing a covershoot for iylm tae. LOVE that of course, and I just know cy would adopt iylm in minutes like they'd care for them so well



skillshare and chingu:

this one would be so fun to me, someone said in an ask that skillshare jk would be offended at how similar he and chingu are but I think they'd get along over shared love of media. I feel like skillshare tae would give some very unwanted pointers to skillshare tae about how to woo someone that doesn't seem to like you but chingu jk's the one that overhears them and starts putting them to unfortunate use","28 Sep, 2023","{'cy', 'noy', 'iylm', 'dna', 'headcanon', 'skillshare', 'chingu', 'le'}",1334186462,

Jeon Jungkook.

Glasses, though he hates wearing them, a tattoo on his ribs in Chinese hanzi that reads: I want to be a human being. He got the tattoo while he was in university. Jeon Jungkook: film major.



Jeon Jungkook. Twenty-one and three months (unafraid of turning twenty-two, terrified of the inevitable thirty), 63kgs (pre-discovery of how invigorating the gym is), 178cm every day. Dark hair, dark eyes, computer-screen pale. Hating glasses but wearing them often since he keeps forgetting to place an order for contacts. Sitting in front of a screen once again to watch a documentary about a young piano protégé from Hong Kong, unsure of what to do next in his life. Jeon Jungkook, bawling his eyes out by the time the credits rolled, and watching it again the next three nights. Jeon Jungkook going with his roommate at the time (twenty-two, 168cm and angry about it, since moved to Norway and out of Jungkook’s life) to a tattoo shop and grimacing through the hour and a half session.","25 Sep, 2023",{'chingu'},1334136017,

for iylm I think Tae cracks a lot of jokes and lightens the mood to make JK feel better about crying, I think the other way around JK is very calm and patient because he wants Tae to know he's going to be fine



skillshare JK is great at getting Tae to stop crying bc he just attaches himself like a koala and tae fuckin melts. I think tae is more panicky but once he stops freaking out he's a very comforting presence bc he's the type of guy to be like 'ok whatever's wrong we can deal with it, we'll figure it out' etc.



both dna and losin end are similar in that they just want someone to be there with them, they don't even have to say anything it's just the comfort of having someone there



chingu is interesting bc I think both of them would be really embarrassed to have the other see them cry. for tae I think JK tries to make everything seem like it'll be okay and since he has no idea what he's talking about it makes Tae laugh and stop crying. for JK I think Tae sits and holds his hand even though it's not appropriate in the workplace","24 Sep, 2023","{'cy', 'noy', 'iylm', 'dna', 'headcanon', 'skillshare', 'chingu', 'le'}",1333788482,

I think she definitely says 'dada' first, I know I've also written that she clicks with Tae really fast like that's his baby girl 🥹 



for JK it was for sure so overwhelming he's always been a more hands-on learner LOL so I think finally actually seeing his kid it really sunk in for the first time. like it finally felt real.

3560,For all your taekooks: who's the more protective one in the relationship and what triggers their protectiveness over the other?,"cy: ok CONTROVERSIALLY I'm gonna say Tae. HEAR ME OUT but I feel like as much as JK is the overprotective dad/husband trope I think if we're talking about them in a relationship it's actually Tae. JK's the one that's constantly ripping his heart out of his chest and presenting it to Tae ('I'm too sensitive with you') and I think Tae's really protective of that. I think JK's protective against outside forces but Tae's the one protecting JK's heart with his own actions. he holds so much power and he doesn't take it lightly. I think one of the reasons he's so slow to anger or getting upset with JK is because he knows how awful it makes JK feel and he wants to protect his feelings. I think in the same way Tae is JK's ultimate love Tae recognizes that and makes JK his ultimate priority, if that makes sense. it definitely gets triggered any time JK cries (which is to say it gets triggered A LOT)



noy: also Tae! he's ride or die for his darling and even though he's the more soft-spoken one he's more WELL-spoken, so he acts as JK's mouthpiece a lot when he's not feeling his best. as we've seen it's triggered whenever someone talks badly about JK and he's not there to defend himself, Tae sure as hell is going to war for him



iylm: Tae again, lol. I think because he's the one that sparked so much of the change in JK's personality and helped grow his confidence he's really protective of that. triggers whenever he catches JK trying to revert back to old ways



skillshare: JK - any tongue that rises against Taehyung shall fall (other than his own of course, because what's the point of being his boyfriend if he can't boss him around now and then). the 'nobody can talk shit about my boyfriend but me' type, and whenever he hears someone say anything negative he's at the ready to disprove their claims with like 1000 examples of when Taehyung's been completely wonderful



dna: JK, we all saw this coming, he's like physically protective over Tae. triggered by any potential dangerous situations such as Taehyung's tripping or maybe getting a papercut or having to converse with the world's biggest asshole rival scientist



losin end: gotta go JK with this one only because now that he knows more about Tae's life he's really determined to shield him from further hurt. Tae's more interested in showing him the world while JK's interested in protecting him from the bad parts of it. triggered by any and all of Tae's awful, horrific friends



chingu: it's Tae but not because he sees JK as another kid he has to take care of. rather I think he knows a lot of times JK doesn't recognize when people are talking down or making fun of him, so Tae feels obligated to step in. I feel like JK's idea of being protective is hiring Tae a security guard LOL but he'd try his best.","23 Sep, 2023","{'cy', 'noy', 'iylm', 'dna', 'headcanon', 'skillshare', 'chingu', 'le'}",1333790987,

2. How do your taekooks sleep together (like actually sleep) ? I need details on whose head goes on whose chest or who ends up being kicked off the bed bc the other is an active sleeper","clothing:

iylm tae: I remember writing in the fic he lays directly on top of JK like a plank lol. obviously drools a bunch



skillshare tae: a saint for putting up with jk's awful bed-sharing behavior. manages to wrangle him into submission by being the big spoon but resigns himself to getting scolded in the morning since jk has to pry himself free



dna tae: restless, talks in his sleep. not really a cuddler but mostly bc he's never really shared a bed with anyone. sleeps on his side with his hands by his face



losin end tae: this man sleeps so peacefully and calmly, actually looks like how people sleep in movies. side sleeper, likes to have some white noise

3523,"Hey KSA ! How are you doing these days ? I hope you're doing well and feeling happy :) 



I read (and reread) your fics, especially CY my beloved, whenever I'm stressed (so basically on a weekly basis at this point).

 

My most recent reread was Skillshare, and it had been a while since I last read it, so I have a very self-indulgent question : 

Just like JK, I am currently living and working in a foreign country and I usually feel very self-conscious about my accent and finding the ""perfect"" words to not sound dumb (bc French people WILL ask you where your lil accent is from). 

And, in the beginning, JK has moments like that, he even feels judged & mocked by Tae (RIP king of pining). So I was wondering how Tae actually feels and thinks in moments where JK mispronounces a word or uses the wrong words - what goes through his head ? Does he also make an effort to speak more Korean ?



Also, I looooove Losin End, i love how you write them, i love that they're in their forties, i love how they make each other feel less alone in their loneliness, it's ridiculous how well you can write such deeply human characters - I'm really curious about what's gonna happen in the next 4 chapters, if Tae is ever gonna learn about what happened to Yugyeom and that JK was Spiderman or if it's forever gonna be two people just accepting each other bc that's beautiful too. Also a big fuck you to Lev, I hope a piano falls on his head. 



Anyway, very long message but thank you thank you thank you for being such a huge source of comfort !","oof I send you condolences and prayers for living among the French I've heard stories from friends they are not always the nicest to foreigners. hopefully you meet all the good ones :)



on the other hand Tae thinks it's the cutest thing in the world when Jungkook does it. after they get together he does try to speak more Korean especially when JK's tired and doesn't want to have to focus too hard. I think Tae corrects him so much because HE would feel embarrassed getting something incorrect so he thinks in his own special Tae way that he's actually helping (poor guy is just a little bit dense and very blinded by love). but overall once he figures out JK doesn't want his help unless expressly asked he just enjoys listening to him



and yes Lev deserves to have an entire symphony of instruments fall on his head","21 Sep, 2023","{'skillshare', 'le', 'cy'}",1333554864,

3455,HYPOTHETICALLY which one would sacrifice themselves (in some way) for the other’s happiness/well-being in each of your works,"ok ok so to answer this question PROPERLY we have to agree that both would of course sacrifice themselves for their partner's wellbeing, but I think this is who would actually come out on top (i.e. if they were in a sacrifice showdown this one would do everything humanly possible to make sure they were the ones to put their partner first)



cy: Jungkook. Jungkook one thousand million trillion billion percent and he's at the top of this list over any other character he IS the sacrifice man. no one is doing it like him because you just cannot outdo the doer. Jungkook.



noy: Taehyungggg he's not even letting Jungkook get near a sacrifice of any kind



iylm taekook: Jungkook, though out of all my pairings this might be the toughest back and forth. I just think JK would default to this mode more often since he's used to not getting what he wants. if it happened too much Tae would absolutely call him out on it though



iylm namjin: Jin bc I think Joon would know if he was the one to make the sacrifice and Jin knew it'd tear him up inside



iylm yoonmin: Jimin actually, which I think surprises them both for the opposite reason of namjin. I think  he'd make the sacrifice even if he knew it'd make yoongi upset



iylm hobi: that lovely man would lay down his life for any one of his friends but I think he'd be very touched to find out that all of them would do it right back



skillshare: Taehyung and you know that motherfucker would do it in the quietest, most gut-wrenching way and go out of his way to make sure JK never knows a thing about it



dna: Jungkook bc I think this question applies to them in a more literal way than the other fics lol. like JK is for sure physically going to sacrifice himself to save Tae and he's definitely been sacrificing his feelings and honestly in the name of Tae's safety for the past 10 years



losin end: Taehyung. he wants JK to be happy and feels he deserves it for being such a good person

don't know if it's spoiler but can we know a bit of dna taekook first impressions when they first met? 

i think they mention they met each other in middle school (or junior high school? don't know if there's a difference if i'm honest), so i'd love to know if there was something memorable😭

lots of love, hope you're having the greatest time ever💜",I think I wrote in dna that JK remembers them going to middle school together but Tae doesn't. JK definitely thought Tae was super smart and I think he was probably a little intimidated by all the friends Tae had so he probably didn't try to get closer. I think Tae starts to notice JK in high school when there's another super smart kid doing just as well and in some cases beating him in classes. it ramps up more after namjoon dies but I think tae sees how shy and reserved JK is and tries to include him in things since it seems like he's not great at asserting himself,"16 Sep, 2023",{'dna'},1333033989,

3451,"i’ve been meaning to do this for a long time now so here goes a chingu rant:

up until the last chapters ending, I was a bit nervous on how you would get tae to be romantically attracted to jk. It mainly feels like he has the intense need of parenting jk but also you can tell he just wants the best for him and doesn’t mind how a grown man is like a little kid at heart. Maybe i’m wrong but I feel like that’s one of the reasons he’d fall for jk, like he could bring out this fun crazy side out of him and not only be this “my personality trait? i’m a dad!” guy. I honestly can’t wait for them to take these steps and especially to read how hyunjin reacts to jk coming over more as daddy’s lover instead of just ‘his boss’. I also feel like jk and hyunjin have so much in common, they could really relate and jk probably sees himself in the little guy :( I hope hyunjin can look up to jk and see him as a superhero who he wants to be like one day (asides from his super amazing dad) and tae’s concerns regarding hyunjin and him being like his mom makes me so sad (tbh I kind of want him to be like his mom, bc im curious but if you decide not to I can understand since yea its a hard and sensitive topic). Side note: hwayoung makes me feel so so much. I can personally relate to her a lot and I wanna give her hug. Thank you for writing a character like her. 



Thanks for all your writing, seriously im hr biggest fan in a (non) deranged way possible. I always reread your stuff over and over again. I can’t get enough🤍 youre amazing ksa!!!!",yeah that's so true! even writing the first couple chapters I was like...uh how is this gonna end up working out but I think what you said about him realizing he's not just 'dad' or 'secretary' is gonna be super important to his character growth. atm he's only focused on what he and his family needs. but I think jk's gonna help him realize what he wants. thank you for loving hwayoung! she's gonna be in the story more later on but I really have a lot of love for her too and she reminds me of a few different people I know so I'm trying to make sure she has good things happen,"16 Sep, 2023",{'chingu'},1332645067,

iylm jk: isolated date - anything where it's just him and tae, usually on his boat but he even likes when they just drive around and sit in the car to just talk. his ideal date is just anywhere they get to be totally alone together

iylm tae: similar to jk but in the opposite way - he loves when they get alone time around a bunch of other people (i.e. hiding in the back row of a movie, going to bookstores where none of the older patrons recognize him, eating dinner at private restaurants, etc.) he likes doing things in public bc he wants to spoil jk with a good time

iylm jimin: The Goldfinch (lol)

iylm hobi: he's a Dumas guy he loves the three musketeers trilogy (man in the iron mask is his favorite) and his all-time favorite is Count of Monte Cristo



skillshare jk: loves graphic novels (when he tells tae that Tae's like 'oh you mean like heartstopper?' cue JK showing him his Junji Ito collection and Tae being slightly horrified)

3365,which one of your characters has the most screen time?? what app do they spend the most time on and why!!,"least to most:



losin end jk: who's he talking to on that thing

iylm yoongi: he's paranoid about the government and data stealing he barely uses his phone other than texts and calls

losin end tae: has plenty of people to call and text but thinks it's more romantic to use a landline and send letters if he just wants to catch up

iylm joon: similar to yoongi in that he only uses his phone for texts and calls

noy jk: will scroll on twitter when he's bored but his first choice of something to do is play a video game or go paint so the phone usually just sits untouched

iylm jk: wasn't allowed to have a phone until he was in high school and I feel like he'd keep it in his room most of the time when he's with his parents. most used app is definitely goodreads

dna tae: most of his screen time is when he has his morning coffee before going to the office and plays Sudoku. also does the daily Bugle crossword and checks to see if they've written anything new about spider-man

cy tae: he goes through phases where he'll get sucked into something or totally forget his phone exists, I think he spends a lot of time on pinterest looking for outfit inspo in college

chingu jk: prefers to screw around on his computer because he's modded it to be exactly what he wants. just can't seem to find the perfect phone and it irks him

chingu tae: wouldn't use it that much if it weren't for jk blowing up his phone with voice messages

iylm hobi: I think he uses his phone about as much as a normal person but for some reason I just KNOW he responds to all serious business emails on it and the 'sent from my phone' line that pops up under his name has everyone quaking

skillshare tae: checks his work emails on it over the weekend which jk HATES, I think he uses YouTube the most because he loves watching random videos like 'restoring a 2002 gameboy' or like 'what an ancient egyptian burial service would look like'

iylm jimin: not as much anymore but he was big into social media before he got serious with yoongi so he had a lot of time logged on those apps. now facetime is easily the biggest from when he talks with tae

dna jk: avid spotify listener

iylm jin: constantly on the microsoft teams and outlook email apps he's a business ownerrrr

noy tae: that spotify is working overtime he's in the top 0.01% of listeners for his favorite artists every year

cy jk: work-obsessed 🤝 loves taking pics of his family 🤝 mobile games when he's waiting around for tae 🤝 catches up on new anime episodes on his commute

skillshare jk: spends a lot of time reading webtoons and watching tiktok, also sometimes uses his phone to make quick edits to some of his art so he has a lot of screentime racked up on graphic design stuff

iylm tae: he's just a phone boy he loves his phone! lots of time on social media apps since he posts a lot on his own accounts but also likes to keep track of what all his friends are up to. he likes to stay connected to everything","09 Sep, 2023","{'cy', 'noy', 'iylm', 'dna', 'headcanon', 'skillshare', 'chingu', 'le'}",1332072108,

iylm yoongi: did get scammed buying what he thought was a designer bag for Jimin that was just super on-sale but Jimin didn't have the heart to tell him it was obviously fake

iylm hobi: I think he falls for drop shipping scams over anything else



skillshare jk: my guy's using a VPN and browsing on duck duck go you are not getting access to even try to scam him

skillshare tae: he doesn't get scammed but he does get strongarmed by those cashiers at stores to join rewards clubs and stuff so he always has like 1000 spam emails

BUT at the same time JK is the one who will spend $25 on individual pretzel packs because they have Iron Man on them but Tae makes them buy the family size bag instead for $7 because it's so ridiculous to spend that much



noy: Tae keeps track of what they need to restock on and asks JK what he wants to make that week so he can add it to the list. JK is determined to get in and out as fast as possible but he does always try to sneak like 6 different desserts into the cart for Tae that Tae (only sometimes) makes him put back



IYLM

taekook: JK does the real shopping while Tae gets them prizes from those coin machines at the exit



namjin: Jin could go on Supermarket Sweep and become the reigning champ he's got it down to a science. Namjoon's not even allowed to push the cart because the last time he did he knocked over an entire display of pasta sauce and it looked like a crime scene



yoonmin: Yoongi is serious, Jimin gets whatever he wants and Yoongi sure as shit lets him

 

Hobi: loves a good impulse purchase but knows his limits





skillshare: JK is serious, Tae tries his best to be serious as well but he's very bad at picking produce so after the fifth nearly rotten banana run JK assigns him to cart duty only



dna: Tae is the serious one but only because Yoongi writes out a list for him before hand, JK is the king of snacks and trying new stuff that looks interesting. always sways Tae to get it so he can 'test his hypothesis'

cy jk: IU stan since he was a kid, he'll always be in love with her. he cries to her palette album like every other week. also likes Seventeen and he's been known to enjoy an NCT song or two (including Sticker of course)



cy tae: calendar Tae is a Shinee truther!! I feel like he and Jimin would've followed them since like middle school and for sure Minho was one of his first sexual awakenings





noy jk: not really k-pop but this is the most DPR IAN fan I've ever seen in my life



noy tae: soloist LeeHi and producer Bronze





iylm jk: Day6! he loves their indie rock sound



iylm tae: ahah, HERE is our army. I remember an ask a while back about who would be a bts stan and I really think IYLM Tae would. he'd resonate with a lot of the music and I think he'd love everything BT21 and be super into keeping up with Run BTS and everything. I remember saying in that ask that Hobi would for sure go to a concert with him and learn the dances with him



iylm jin: very causal BTS stan, Tae would try really hard to convert him and he'd like a few songs but he wouldn't totally get the magic of it



iylm joon: I think he'd like indie artists like jannabi he'd really like the whimiscal aspect of their stuff



iylm jimin: he's a Blackpink stan and number 1 Lisa bias and one of the biggest arguments he and Tae ever had was over bts vs. blackpink



iylm yoongi: Girls Generation forever 1 bitch



iylm hobi: Red Velvet because he has taste





skillshare jk: Stray Kids, he swears it's not just because he thinks they're hot but it half is. I can't see him being super into k-pop, I think he'd be more of like a j-rock guy. idk if you know the band cvlte but I can see him listening to that. his skz bias is hyunjin though and NO TAEHYUNG IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF HIS LOOKS (not just because, anyway)



skillshare tae: Twice and he's the biggest Jeongyeon bias EVER





dna jk: I think he would really like Le Sserafim he'd love listening to them on his patrols. also a TXT fan especially their newer stuff



dna tae: he loves k-drama soundtracks





losin end jk: he doesn't know anything about them but he really likes newjeans



losin end tae: LOONA stan he would defend Chuu to the death





chingu jk: mamamoo or dreamcatcher

I read your chingu fic and it was kind of soul crushing a little bit, I didn’t realize how lonely I was until I read it, it honestly was eye opening. I don’t know why I felt the need to tell you but I hope you never feel like that again or for the first time, your writing has touched a lot of people and you don’t deserve that, not after everything you’ve done for others. I hope you never stop writing and you’ll always have me as a loyal reader/fan! I wish you nothing but the best! Fighting!","hi anon, this touched me so deeply!

I feel like he probably wants to quit a few times; I don't think it'd be as much because he wants to try something with tae but more that he feels bad lying to Jin. but every time he considers it he thinks about namjoon and the need/guilt he feels to help people always outweighs his thoughts of quitting. I feel like from the story we can see that he carries around so much guilt and puts so much pressure on himself, so I think he falls into that dangerous mentality esp. when it comes to tae and jin that he almost deserves to be seen poorly in their eyes and have a declining relationship because of the events that've happened. so I think part of him refuses to quit because he feels a moral responsibility, and I think the other part of him won't let himself quit because he feels like the isolation is what he deserves","07 Sep, 2023","{'dna', 'headcanon'}",1331979518,
3312,OOOH headcanons for what kind of pets your characters would have,"ok pets:



cy - I've mentioned before I have a headcanon about them getting a dog when they're retirement age/have grandkids and  they have a standoff about the name (Tae wins of course and they name it Rembrandt) and everyone gangs up on Jungkook after he tries to convince them all to name it Fruitcake



noy - canonically have Tannie and Bam, though I can picture Tae wanting to get a bird or something later on. I feel like he'd name it Lolly and take it outside with him in his garden a lot



iylm:



taekook - they both travel too much to dedicate time to a pet but they attempt several times to keep a plant alive and it always goes awry



namjin - will canonically have a dog named Walden in the sequel, I think I said he's an English Pointer?



yoonmin - I can see them picking up some stray cats at some point like Jimin finds a cat on the side of the road and he brings it home and has to basically present a court case to yoongi to keep it, meanwhile yoongi two days later finds the cat's four missing kittens hiding under a fallen tree and scoops them up without a second thought



hobi - tbh he's been traumatized from all the pets his parents have accidentally murdered over the years but I think he'd either have cats or dogs, and he'd always make sure to have 2 at a time so they're never lonely :(



skillshare - Bam is their child fr. I can also see Tae trying multiple times to convince Jungkook they should get a chinchilla



dna - JK would probably have an emotional support fish. hate to say it but Tae is 1000% a creepy pet guy. like spiders, snakes, lizards, worms, bats, etc. would have some tanks and very much not notice if one escaped until it's crawling on his guest.



losin end - tae is an exotic pet owner for sure. like a spider monkey or something that wrecks havoc on everyone else but is perfectly behaved for him. JK is friends with lots of rats and pigeons



chingu - I think JK would get a cat or a dog but end up giving them to tae because he worries it's lonely with just him for company :(","07 Sep, 2023","{'cy', 'noy', 'iylm', 'dna', 'headcanon', 'skillshare', 'chingu', 'le'}",1331981392,

3307,"So.... Just finished reading chingu new ch. Until now I was relating to jungkook so much. I guess some different anon described it wonderfully beforehand and your answer was much better in understanding that, 

As you've said the story isn't even halfway done so I don't know why but I felt like I didn't have enough knowledge/context/background about tae so I couldn't connect to him on the level I could to jungkook, But in this ch I feel like I became a lot more close to tae and actually understand what he is going through..

Until now everytime I read chingu I wanted to give the biggest hug to jungkook but this time I feel like tae gets that hug (soojin also...) 

Like you said this is sort of transition ch  but I really like that we got to know so much more about characters, I wonder how they're gonna get into romance, eager for whatever comes next..

Also.... Wanted to say something to hyunjin. Those placement tests are kinda stupid, I mean, I went through similar process in my school time and never got good results un any of them, but I guess I turned out more than fine academically, So don't worry hyunjin. And also to tae, it's alright. ( I really hope it is👀)","I'm so happy to read that you're relating to chingu tae! honestly he's one of the more difficult characters I've written bc I've really struggled with giving him a personality outside secretary and dad LOL. but at the same time he's in that rut of 9 to 5 life where like, secretary/dad IS his whole personality. I'm excited to write more of his character and have him rediscover himself a little bit. and yes soojin :( I love her so much



also so true about placement tests I was lucky to do well at them when I was in school but it was only because I was good at taking tests. which is like the dumbest way to measure someone's intelligence lol. rest assured hyunjin and tae will figure it out together","06 Sep, 2023",{'chingu'},1331797226,

ok so



basically in the story the hedgehog is asking the fox if he wants help shaking off all the flies that are putting him in a bunch of pain and the fox says no because those flies already have sucked up all the blood they need from him. but if the hedgehog helps him get rid of the flies then NEW ones will come and they'll suck up even more blood and then the fox might just end up dying





so yes tae is the fox and jk is the hedgehog, and all the blood-sucking flies are tae's friends. basically the connection to the story is that JK sees how awful and manipulative Tae's friends are and wants them out of his life. tae already knows they're terrible people but he's too tired to cut them out and he's scared if he does a new group of flies (i.e. more awful people that want to use him) will come along to replace them

Even though my friends and family are there it’s just not the same, they’ve all got their own priorities and can’t spend their time reassuring me that my insecurities are nothing more than that. Growing up I was all about my independence and freedom, but all of a sudden I got hit with this deep need for connection that I’m unable to fulfill on my own, and having never been in a relationship before, I’m not sure where to start. I see this Jungkook and I just want him to get a freaking hug, man. Wish I could physically fight his tragic ex. Maybe I’m just projecting but I feel like he’d weep if someone ever put him first lol.

cy jk: better than most people but not nearly as good as he thinks it is / JEALOUS the most jealous drunk on planet earth also very possessive

cy tae: his limit is 1 and a half cocktails and if he goes even one sip over he's completely smashed / fun drunk, always causing mischief and definitely a giggler



noy jk: normal tolerance but it's improving the more he drinks with Yoongi and his brother / observational drunk, sits quietly and watches everything go down. will occasionally bust out laughing if he sees something funny

noy tae: good tolerance for everything but champagne because he claims the bubbles make him drunker/dizzy drunk, Tae vs. the spins is a constant battle. prefers to just sit and hug jk's arm when it's too much



iylm jk: normal tolerance / shy (well, even shyer) drunk, hides behind Taehyung when he's tipsy

iylm tae: low tolerance but he's getting better / social butterfly drunk

iylm jin: very good, been building it for years with all that fine whiskey / weepy drunk

iylm joon: standard tolerance / slurring his words drunk but determined to keep speaking

iylm jimin: good / blabbermouth drunk like any secret or hot gossip he knows is getting told and if he doesn't like you he's going to let you know to your face and tell you exactly why

iylm yoongi: all the whiskey tolerance in the world and yet he can't handle one long island iced tea / cuddly drunk

iylm hobi: great tolerance / even when he /is/ drunk no one can really tell



skillshare jk: good tolerance, can kick off at the work function without disgracing himself / what I am NOT drunk type of drunk, also a giggler when he gets called out on it

skillshare tae: gone off one shot of soju it's so horrendously bad for him / rambling drunk it's impossible to get him to shut up about whatever topic he's info-dumping on you



dna jk: can't really get drunk / nauseous drunk I think bc he'd have to drink so much

dna tae: doesn't drink much on purpose / discuss-the-secrets-of-the-universe drunk



losin end jk: god-tier tolerance have we forgotten the 5 bottles of tequila / jumpy drunk, he can't relax since he's not in full possession of his mental faculties

losin end tae: self-proclaimed lightweight / flirty drunk



chingu jk: fine but he gets really drunk off curacao / lonely drunk

chingu tae: a respectable tolerance, he can put away a few beers and some shots without getting too messy / party 

drunk. he's dancing on tables, he's taking his shirt off, he's buying a round for the bar, he's taking over the dj booth-","02 Sep, 2023","{'cy', 'noy', 'iylm', 'dna', 'headcanon', 'skillshare', 'chingu', 'le'}",1331481328,

I've written times where he's said/mentioned he knows he's not as verbal and obvious with his love the way JK is, though a lot of the time that results in insecurities on JK's part. that's a really interesting thought though I feel like it wouldn't be a conclusion he comes to naturally. I think with him being so unconventional and out of touch with his feelings he probably relies a lot of JK interpreting the things he does. like something HE knows he's doing that someone else might not understand as a declaration of love, but after being with JK for so long it's easy for JK to pick up on.

3231,"i know we don't bring this kind of things on here  and im sorry about that but i just wanted to point something out that's really bothering me; a lot of people are taking this song recommendation discourse as a chance to be homophobic, towards joon and ESPECIALLY towards who wrote the song, and that's not cool, i don't like that one bit, and it really doesn't matter if these are your beliefs and that's what your religion preaches, your religion shouldn't give you the pass to be an homophobic asshole. i feel like the song itself was never the problem atp but it's meaning and Joon specifically are, kpop stans are truly the most hypocrite and disgusting people in this world. Religious trauma is a very sensitive topic, especially for queer people. Again, I apologize for the rant🙏🏻","all good! as long as people state their thoughts/opinions respectfully I'm happy to have convos like this on here. I haven't dug much into the drama because it's not really for me to comment publicly on in any way, but I get your point and I lean really heavy towards that side too. I think the only people that can really speak on if it's offensive or not are actual muslims. and even then like you said religious trauma is rampant in any religion, so while people are making the argument it's offensive to islam I think with media literacy you can understand the song is not singling that one religion out. though that in turn has led a lot more people to be outraged because ig it puts their beliefs under fire? but as someone who grew up in the church and also is queer and has complicated feelings about both things I don't think it's a fair discussion to say the song is Islamophobic or whatever kind of phobic you want to call it. it's clearly written by someone who struggles with similar things and to boil that down to islamophobia is missing the entire point. things like intersectionality exist and they're vital to understanding and interacting with things you yourself are not a part of. I can't speak for how a muslim person would feel listing to this song but I can understand if they'd take offense. Just like if someone read the lyrics and bothered to research the meaning behind them maybe they could understand why that song was written and titled bad religion in the first place.



the song aside, I agree attacking joon is fucking stupid. again it goes back to media literacy and people's complete lack of empathy and comprehension. again, intersectionality. just because the song is 'attacking' religion doesn't mean it can be written off when the entire point of it is to bring up an experience about homophobia, within the CONTEXT of religion. two things can exist in conflict with each other and it is actually possible to hold both ideas in your head at the same time even if it makes you uncomfortable to contemplate. and if you don't want to, then don't? we all love bts and namjoon but it's so not that serious. he's one person out of billions and if your opinion is different than his on this I think somehow we'll all survive it. there's no reason to attack someone's personal beliefs or character especially when his 'attack' on yours was an instagram story screenshot?



I'll admit I'm biased as well in this situation which is why I haven't really wanted to say much, but to your point about religion giving people a pass I've seen it too many times in my life and it's ridiculous. if you want to say you don't owe it to joon to have comprehension about complex topics then he doesn't owe it to you to explain them","21 Aug, 2023",{'cy'},1329942366,

3216,"Just curious. I think you’re still young but how do you describe such deep emotions that not even people twice or 3x your age have figured out? Do you sit down and think about it? Or does it just flow naturally? Are you an empath or been described as such? It’s just your writing is so rich and all your characters have such dimension individually that I’m really starting to think this is beyond just planning an outline and that this is truly your genius! 

      Like is  there examples you can give on who inspires each one of your characters? And does their personality and life story just come to you or do you sit down and outline each and every character? Btw imagining Harlot Claudine and juiced up post military Jin, I NEEED A COOOOLD SHOWER","this is so interesting because I don't think anyone's ever called me an empath before HAHA



idk I think if you knew me in my real life you would see I'm not very outspoken with expressing emotions. personality-wise I'm pretty outgoing but in terms of communicating how I feel or having discussions with other people about feelings I'm definitely more of an observer. it's hard for me to articulate my feelings a lot (me and CY tae are soul twins with that) so honestly I've found that writing lets me better explore just the idea of feelings in general. overall I'm a pretty neutral person about most things so it's almost like a fun exercise to think about how someone might react in the situations I write. some of it's based in personal experience (definitely a lot of the sentiments and advice are things I've either said or have had said to me before) and then other stuff is me just looking at the plot and the characters and figuring out how each would react and why. I wouldn't say any one character is inspired by any one person in my life; outside of bangtan any of my original characters are mostly born of me thinking 'I want to write a person like this' and then it just spirals from there. and then for bts it's more of me figuring out which facets of their personalities I want to focus on. plus my fics are all plot-wise really different from one another so that helps the characters feel different too","17 Aug, 2023",{'cy'},1329172628,
3215,anniversary gifts that cy taekook would give to each other?,"hmmm I feel like jungkook has a running excel sheet with all the clothes/fashion items he sees Tae show interest in (that he's able to actually look up online anyway) and he usually pulls from that along with a cheesy card. for bigger anniversaries he pulls out the big romantic guns (see 20 page beach anniversary live reading) and of course he goes for the traditional dinner and flowers every time too.



tae is funny, I think he would just acquire random piles of things he means to give people as gifts because he'll see it and think of them, and then he ends up with this closet full of secret gifts he can't do anything with until their birthday or christmas etc. though I think for anniversaries in particular he keeps his own running list of things that are causing jk stress in his life and as a gift he tries to take care of as many as he reasonably can (ie calling the cable company, getting their sink fixed, etc.) he would for sure fake a Tae Day a few days before their anniversary so JK leaves him to his own devices and he knocks out a bunch of stuff. he's not great with cheesy cards so I think that'd be his own way of expressing his feelings and jk looks forward to catching all the things he's taken care of secretly each year



basically I think they'd speak each other's love languages to each other so Tae would do acts of service and JK would give gifts

3206,"okay. but how would the story turn out if cy jungkook had died before tae though? from your perspective as an author, how do you think it would be like (if you ever thought about this, of course lol)?","OF COURSE I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT





I think JK is right in his voicemail when he says Tae would've had an easier time of it if JK went first. well- okay, maybe not easier but I think he would've been able to endure it longer. to JK's point he would seek comfort in his kids and grandkids more than JK did, but I think that's also bc Tae had experience doing that earlier on in life (when his own dad died he leaned on JK but he didn't underestimate the healing power of his kids either). whereas JK has always had Tae as his outlet, whether that's his emotions or pain or fear or love. I always think of Tae almost as a conduit, the love that JK pours into him and him alone then gets poured out through Tae into the world. so while I think Tae would be just as devastated he would express his grief in a healthier way. I don't imagine he'd be interested in the concept of 'moving on' just like JK wasn't, but I do think he'd make efforts to be more present than JK did. (not that it's a bad thing JK retreated into himself, grief is so complex and there's no 'right' answer of how to process it.)



I think the way that they would grieve is similar to how they saw each other. like, to Tae, JK is the sun, the most important star in his galaxy that his life revolves around. I see him moving in with one of the kids pretty soon after and living with them. I can see him and the kids talking about JK a lot and keeping his memory alive, I think by this point in his life Tae would know it's good to remember even if it's painful. I also think that he'd be less visibly sad because like JK says in the voicemail he can just go to Taehyung world. he would devote a lot of time to the rest of his family because he knows and is so perfectly certain he'll see Jungkook again, so there's no reason to be afraid of missing him. I do think what would really hit him is when JK is gone and he sees just how much JK did that went unspoken. little things like buying him sweet treats and heating up water for his tea and matching his socks in the laundry. after a few weeks of seeing the hole JK left behind he decides to move. he doesn't want to live the life they had if it's not together, he'd rather pause and wait until they're one again.



JK, on the other hand. oh man. to JK, Tae /is/ the galaxy. he doesn't move in with the kids, he doesn't share in the grief, he doesn't wait (not patiently at least). I think in those eight months they're apart JK stays in the house and heats up water and matches socks and buys sweet treats and keeps living their life, because he really doesn't know how to live anyone else's. he's not strong enough and he's too tired to try and live a new one.



really, I think the main difference is that Tae would pour the rest of his love into their family, and when he runs out without JK there to fill him up again, he knows he's ready to go.



JK can only pour the rest of his love into someone who's no longer there. except the phone.","16 Aug, 2023",{'cy'},1329285252,

3194,"First of all, I really like your writing, curious cat replies. I'm not good at English, and expressing my opinions is something I always struggle with, but I'm going to try. Each story of yours is different and deserves its own praise. And even though my favourites are skill share and DNA, Cy strikes me (I think it does for everyone). Frankly, the best way to describe me in the last three years is that I was lost. Still, I am. I don't know how I became like this. I lost control over my life. For myself. Sometimes I still ponder over the moral ambiguity of fanfiction(I'm 21, but I still feel like a child, and there is a lot that I don't know). Anyway, some things are not black and white; maybe that's it. And apart from that I think I use all these stories as a way of escapism.Running away from my life. Just because I'm scared of everything. I just want to be a kid again so that someone will look after me and make decisions for me. I have no friends and I keep postponing everything.There are some days where I spent all of my time scrolling through my mobile to find a good story(I'm so picky when it comes to stories). I shouls have control over myself. Because everything has a limit. But running away from problems is so tempting. Maybe it's weird, but whenever I complete reading your stories , they make me want to go back to my life and make myself happy. Your characters make me want to be a better person. Ok maybe enough about myself.

I read Skillshare more times than I was ok to admit. And DNA Tae inspires me a lot, and I love him so much(also, he makes me want to concentrate on my studies, which I've been neglecting for three years. I used to be a nerd by the way). I don't know what to say about CY JK, his love for his tae is the one I can die for( not that it is any less in reverse). And all others members in your stories, I love them too much. Sometimes I get of each one that they get to have friends like them in their life. Each one. And the way you write, I don't know, it's really wonderful. I wish I had some better vocublary. I'm not saying that your characters are perfect or something. Everyone has their own flaws. But everything together makes them them. 

What I want to say is that your characters makes me want to be happy.  I want to say more but it's not easy for me.(Also there is 3000 letters limit) I don't even if I will press enter after I finish this. Thank you so much for creating these incredible pieces.

Even though I don't know you in person, I wish there is a person like you in my life. It may be my friendless lonely soul speaking.

un admirateur timide et maladroit 💜","first of all, sorry for the long wait for a response. I read this ask and I knew I wanted to wait until I had more time to sit and give it the response it deserves, because this was truly so beautiful and partly heartbreaking to read. so much of what you said I relate to on a deeply personal level (and I think at lot of others do as well). skillshare in particular is such a close fic to my heart and the problems I write them having are ones I've wrestled with for years, trying to find passion and afraid to try for things when you know you won't be able to do them perfectly.

in the age of the internet and instant connection I feel like it's easier to be more alone than ever--after all, half the time we're all communicating through a screen. we know each other but how much can we truly /know/? and yet while we're feeling lost and friendless it's exactly what you said--escapism. life sucks so much sometimes and it's easy to lose yourself in something that brings you comfort. I'm not totally sure if you wanted me to respond to this or if you maybe wanted my advice, but nothing I could recommend would be true. sometimes we just want to avoid problems because they're problems, and why would we run towards the things causing us pain? making decisions and becoming an adult is the hardest fucking thing in the world. if we don't know who we are how the hell are we supposed to tell everyone else? being a child is always easier. friends are hard to find and hard to keep, and part of why I write these characters is to make friends of my own. for me, writing them is similar to the way you described reading them. life is lonely but often I don't feel that way because I write. I don't know what this answer really means to accomplish other than a diary entry of my own in response to yours, but I guess also I'll add thank you. whenever anyone tells me they relate to my writing or it helps them, it's the biggest compliment I could ever get. wishing you a form of happiness that sits beside you for a while.

anon asked about tae's last words and now I wonder what were kook's last words. 🥲","ok no wait bc I have THOUGHTS about this I've always wanted to like commission art for it or something but basically here is the vision:



post-voicemails he goes back to the house and has a quiet day, spends time with the kids and relives some old memories with them. I feel like he would kinda know, you know? like he'd be like if not tonight then really soon, so I think he's extra sweet with them and before they all go to bed he sits with each of them individually and tells them he loves them. Jolie for sure finds it strange but I think Ji is also more in tune with it and just tells her to not make anything of it and end the night on a happy note. and then in the morning when the two of them wake up even before they leave their rooms they just know :(



BUT



meanwhile (also forgot to add this but after Tae is gone JK wears his rings bc he wants the silver and gold to still be together 😭) he goes to bed and falls asleep.



cue a very similar moment to the one he has the day they get married (that part where he's waking up one sense at a time) and it's all so much like that and he's smiling to himself bc he's happy to be having such a good dream. THEN he feels the rings that he's supposed to be wearing on Tae's hand instead, and when he opens his eyes after eight long months this is finally the morning Tae is there.



whether it's real or a hallucination or he's already got one foot in the afterlife it doesn't matter, either way Tae is actually there and they're reunited again.

3119,"Omg chapter suggestions for CY?!? The pressure! Let’s see…

1. I’m still stuck on the uncles taking the kids camping then losing one of them and the adventure that ensues while Tae and JK try to have dates and talks without talking about the kids and they just ended up eating ice cream cuddling in front of the TV talking about JiTaes soccer schedule!

2. Milo and Hobi chapter pls!

3. YOONMIN ORIGIN STORY! Or just story cause I feel like they just got together without knowing their together.

4. The convo when JiTae tells Jungkook he doesn’t want to do finance.

5. Crossover???? Like CY Tae gets to work with IYLM model Tae and they have a heart to heart about their JK’s and their insecurities and they bond over that while secretly wondering if they were twins separated at birth.

6. Jin and Claudine origin story . Did JK like her btw when they first met???

7. Just like your last story where it was just a sweet story about everyday life of them as dads, how about another halaboji story with the grandkids? Just a babysitting adventure with them and maybe them finding out some weird quirk with the kids like how their grandson is a genius.



Okay you need to tell me to stop bc I miss CY so much I could go on forever…😭💜","1. yes very obsessed with the idea of a Namjoon/Yoongi/kids collab that goes so fucking wrong in every way meanwhile JK's like 'something's wrong I feel that something is wrong' and Tae keeps assuring him it's all fine (of course he's getting texts from Yoongi every other second that are like 'can your kid eat paint he just swallowed a little bit' and tae's like 'sure like a spoonful is fine')



2. that'll be the next one! I have a good chunk of it written and it melts my hearttttt



3. yes ok!! I have like 2 different chapters I want to do for them one with their kinda 'origin' like when Jimin's in college up to when they finally get together after he comes back from LA, and then for the second I really wanna do like the years after that when Jimin's trying to kickstart his singing career and all that. writing them in that one valentine's chapter was so fun and I lovedddd writing them in my IYLM fic so I want to give them a fleshed out story in calendar



4. also have half of this written! I feel like it always gets pushed to the bottom of the list when other stuff comes up tho lol



5. I HAVE IDEAS ABOUT THISSSSSS I kinda wanted to do a crossover between all the tks but ik it'd be super ambitious LOL...would have to think long and hard to make it all work. but yes the dynamic between CY TK and IYLM TK would be the sweetest I think, like CY for sure would take IYLM under their wing and I think CY Tae would MELT at IYLM jk's lisp like ahhhhhh he'd find him so precious



6. when I do the Vegas chapter there will be more Claudien lore lol. it's slowly becoming canon



7. yessss okay I have 2 ideas for grandparent chapters, one is really sweet and fluffy and the other one is really depressing puke from tears stuff...we'll see how it goes","27 Jul, 2023","{'iylm', 'cy'}",1326374324,

3054,"hey ksa!!! hows it goin? :) been missing the whole cy gang a lot lately i swear like 70% of my brain is just cy brain rot. anyway i was just thinking about ms tres jolie~ was she accepting of herself growing up (sexuality wise) or was it something she struggled with? since yknow, it mightve been different since she already had two dads (more open mindedness and all) but self acceptance can kinda be a fickle thing? i was just wondering how it was for her? and also did she have a specific coming out? was it a big deal? i gotta know. please indulge my cy brainrot~~ and most importantly, have a good day!","oooo yes Jolie discourse! I've always said I don't think she has an official 'coming out', I think one day she just shows up with a girl and that's that. given how independent and confident she is, and like you said having 2 dads, I think she doesn't really struggle with her sexuality? maybe that's a cheap answer but at the same time it's nice to picture someone who's comfortable in their own skin - I think Jolie has other things she struggles with but that's not really one of them. in terms of coming out tho even though nobody says anything (bc they all know her well enough to know she doesn't want to make a big deal of it), I imagine JK comes into her room randomly later in the week and in a really mushy gushy way tells her that he'll always love and accept her (after which he claims he said 'for no reason in particular')","11 Jul, 2023",{'cy'},1323326836,

Sorry my TL is in horny shambles and I miss u and ur writing !?!,"lolllll I feel like CY JK is resigned to it after so many years (whenever I picture my tks meeting one another I always picture CY tk as the oldest of the group) even though he's eyeing his irl double just to make sure he doesn't try anything. and then for NOY he's just miffed his irl version is arguably cooler than him (and they both have a tattoo sleeve so he can't even use that as leverage). I think his Tae would gush about how adorable irl JK is and want to baby him the whole time so eventually NOY JK would get over it.



chingu JK strikes me as the type to order things in the middle of the night he has no real need for and his apartment is cluttered with so much of it - cue him ordering an ab roller on a whim and using it in the middle of he and Tae's meetings. he only agrees to stop if Taehyung tries it out so Tae resigns himself to it until JK inevitably gets bored with it and moves onto the next thing","11 Jul, 2023","{'noy', 'chingu', 'cy'}",1324439197,

CY: pink cups, JK grabs them the second he clocks the table. Tae (of course) doesn't read the sign and thinks the colors represent something else entirely the whole night until JK explains after he sees Yoongi and Jimin both holding green cups



NOY: also pink, but Tae's the one to grab them right away



IYLM: pink! JK doesn't notice the signs at first so he picks a purple cup for the color and then gets mortified but luckily Tae snagged a pink one afterwards for whenever he finished that drink



Skillshare: I like to think JK starts out with a blue cup and makes Tae work to convince him why he should match with Tae's pink cup (all in good fun of course)



DNA: c'mon. the green cup was made for them.



Losin' End: Tae's double-fisting purple cups the whole night but he lets JK take pink so he won't have to deal with strangers talking to him



Chingu: LOLLLLLL I think Tae takes a blue cup but writes 'I have a kid' on it just in case. and then JK keeps forgetting where he put his cup throughout the party so he ends up with every color by the end of the night","10 Jul, 2023","{'cy', 'noy', 'iylm', 'dna', 'headcanon', 'skillshare', 'chingu', 'le'}",1323068252,

it's actually funny, for JK's origin of how he became spider-man I had no plans to include that in the story because I was just going to have it be the same as it in the comics. but more people started commenting that same question and I realized I actually took for granted that most people know the spider-man story (and if you don't then don't look it up bc it'll get spoiled a bit before I post it in DNA lol) so I'm going to work it in more. I'm really excited to add more to it especially because I really love the namjin + jungkook dynamic and I wanted to incorporate more flashbacks of their lives together so I'll make sure to explain it all clearly 👍🏼 



and then for him not having friends, I wouldn't say he had NO friends before spider-man, but I feel like he was really shy as a kid and loved being with namjin/was super close with them, so even the friends he did have weren't like his best friends ya know. and then once he became spider-man it got really hard to keep those alive and then after namjoon was gone he pushed everyone away. I think he probably had a lot of people post-Namjoon when he came back to school trying at first to befriend him and he wasn't responsive to it at all so they all just gave up. but then when Tae talks to him that time at school and remembers his uncle I think he makes a decision to let Tae in just a little bit, at least while he's spider-man. bc as much as he was angry and grieving I think at that point he was just really lonely","08 Jul, 2023",{'dna'},1324696152,

3002,ooooh and what about losin end jk,"omg ok so I actually have this headcanon (or ig it's canon since I'm the writer) that a lot of his suits were fan-made! I think his first suit is definitely SO busted and home-made and awful and he for sure goes through like an average of 3 suits per year with all the damage. so imagine one time he ends up saving this old couple's dry cleaning business from getting robbed and he stops in a few weeks later to check on them (also canon that he checks on some of the people he saved pretty regularly to make sure they're doing well) and the wife said she made him a new suit!!



I think Losin End differs a bit from DNA in that Losin End has a more established 'superhero' culture (even though he's one of the first) and they're a lot more in the public eye than DNA. that and in LE spider-man is (or was, at one point) a big symbol for the city, so I think he definitely benefits from stranger kindness. like free sandwiches from bodegas and the bus drivers don't make him pay the fare if he needs a quick ride (sometimes his web shooters run out ok??). so I imagine at one point he gets interviewed (more like a reporter lobs questions at him mid-save lol) and asks about the new suit and he's like oh this lady made it for me! and then it kind of becomes a thing later on for people to give him suits they made (a lot are bad and unwearable but a couple of them are really good) and he'll modify as needed bc really he's just happy to have the free materials (as he is broke as all hell)



so all his suits are a bit different depending on who makes them but ultimately it sticks to that blue-red motif. I do feel that Losin End JK's suits would all have pockets for snacks though.","29 Jun, 2023","{'dna', 'le'}",1323489285,

I think after learning a bit of electrician skills from joon he'd rig those white parts of the suit up to light up in the dark if he ever needs to use it (like if he's working to save civilians and they need to be able to save them). and then the other thing I think he'd add bc of his love of science (and the fic name LOL) is that the 'webbing' parts on the suit would look plain from far away but if you get close enough you can see they're little dna double helix chains 😭,"28 Jun, 2023",{'dna'},1323186558,

I get your point about it being toxic thinking but at the same time I think if you told your friend a little bit of how you were feeling it might help? not sure if she knows about your situation, but especially if she makes comments about not having things (even though I can't empathize with being low-income I CAN empathize with having really high-income friends who say stuff like this), maybe you can mention to her that stuff like that is upsetting to hear. I had a friend who was really self-conscious about her weight and would always make comments about how she wanted to be like our other friend who's naturally thin - not grasping that our other friend really struggled with her own body image as well. I think comments like that can fly under the radar as harmless complaints because people just don't realize how they affect people around them. if you feel comfortable enough I think it's a good conversation to start because she might not realize how much stuff like that really upsets you - and it could help you in the long-run if you don't have to be confronted with it so often. jealousy is hard to deal with but I think if your friend is really your friend she'd want to do what she could to make it easier to handle","20 Jun, 2023",set(),1321903430,
2959,"Totally agree omg! There needs to be a ~reason~ for them being enemies. It can make sense if there are situational reasons (e.g., academic rivals/rival sports teams), but it makes no sense if there’s no explanation WHY. Like for example there’s no way I’m reading an ETL vmin fic where they’re “enemies” just ~because~ lmao because that was weird to even write out. This btw is why I think skillshare is so beautifully written!! they’re “enemies” (lol according to jk) because they’re sooo different, but the whole body switching thing almost forces them to see things from the other’s perspective, and that allows them to better understand one another. It’s genius because the universe that they live in/magic they encounter actually adds to the trope. If it wasn’t for the “skill sharing” I don’t think they would have ever actually gotten together.

I also like magical realism (see skillshare) and I'm always down for a cheesy assistant/ceo fic. I don't know if I have a favorite trope overall tho. I think the main reason I don't really like enemies to lovers is because the dynamic is usually the same? or when I read it sometimes it just feels very out of character, like they'll make them insulting each other and mean for no reason other than to fit the trope and I feel like there's more clever ways to make it all work.

ive been rereading *dramatic pause* dna, for like the fourth time because 1. its an amazing fic 15/10 immaculate fic 2. i need the cute sweet parts of tkk in my life tbh 

ANYWAYS i wanted to point out that whenever its tae pov and he wants to figure who spiderman is, he always thinks of jungkook,,,,,almost like he is hoping spiderman /is/ jungkook (referring chapter 9 when he complains to spiderman why he didn't go to his party ""So unless you’re- you’re- I don’t even know, Jungkook Jeon or something, you weren’t there.” or when he specifically said he thought spiderman/was/ jungkook but jk had a wrist injury and spiderman was okay)

And i know a couple of months ago you made a thread of *why* he hasn't figure jk is spiderman and all the accident factors and stuff but I THINK since he was a teenager he hopes spiderman was jk, and he still does even as an adult (quoting chap11 ""But in his dream, it was Jungkook who came through the window."") 

I think his brain has come to the conclusion it IS jungkook but hes too scared to admit it? like he is too scared to believe its actually the same person because WHAT ARE THE ODDS

Anyways just my thoughts at 11pm on a sunday lol take care!❤️🫶🏼",ohhh for sureeee he wants it to be JK - it'd def be a lot easier to sort out his feelings if that was the case 😏 but yeah he's totally connecting the dots but they just aren't clicking in his conscious brain.

LISTEN.



WRITE IT.



FUCKING WRITE IT.



I DON'T CARE IF IT'S BAD WRITE IT.





the thing about writing, and drawing, and any other creative pursuit, is that it takes practice. and that sucks so much ass, but it's true.



but the other thing about writing, especially fanfic writing, and writing that is purely recreational and you aren't compensated for, is that it should be FUN. and for YOU.



pretty much everything I write is because /I/ want to write it (and then read it). my main advice to you is to write what you want/what will make you happy, because at the end of the day, validation from outside parties is not enough of a motivator.



TO THAT POINT - if your writing sucks, so what? if it's not good and it takes up too much brain juice who cares? writing even 1 sentence means you're 1 sentence further than you were a minute ago. and yeah, it takes time and effort but if you're writing for yourself you can throw your expectations out the window. doesn't matter if it's 'good' or not, it just matters that you did it. and you wanted to do it. the end result is not nearly as important as getting there.



so write for yourself, don't worry to much over how it ends up. just try it, and see what happens.





and then, tbh, I'd share it anyway. chances are even if you don't think it's good, someone else will (probably ME)","07 Jun, 2023",set(),1320158073,

I think by the time tk's kids come along it's established that yoongi is the favorite uncle among all the group's kids. he for sure is SUCH a pushover for Jin's girls and I think ji-tae would be a little bit obsessed with him (not as much as his appa of course). but for cy Jimin he strikes me as a little awkward with the whole baby thing so I think it's not until they're all a bit older and can start having real conversations and stuff that he becomes closer to them all. out of all the kids I think Milo and Jolie would really connect with him the best. I can picture the times in high school when Tae's traveling and Jolie is so fed up with JK's hovering that she escapes to her uncles' place and Jimin just chills on the couch with her and listens to her rant about JK while Yoongi makes them dinner in the kitchen,"02 Jun, 2023",{'cy'},1318796878,

2870,"losin end misser again. so i decided to reread again (it still makes me feel all sorts of things every single time) but now i come with questions!

1. you mention somewhere before they start digging through tae's closet that all writers need an eccentricity or two so i was wondering what yours is lol

2. how is jungkook so lovely. i mean this with a lot of adoration but also very genuinely. it seems like once he started letting lose and feeling more comfortable around tae he couldnt help but being soft and affectionate towards him even in a physical sense be it with tiny kisses or touches and he's never been but the absolute sweetest with him from the moment they met. so how can he manage to be so kind and gentle and loving even after everything he's been through both as spidey and as jungkook?","hello anon this made me almost CRY



I love losin end so much it's one of my favorites I've written and the way you just described JK nearly brought me to tears. he IS so lovely and sweet and kind and that's the thing, isn't it? there's something really heartbreaking about him being that way even after everything as you said. there will be more in the fic about his backstory so I don't want to give too much away, but I think he stayed so loving and gentle because at the end of the day, he wants to be treated the way he treats others. the whole spidey aspect of the story is more in the background, but even outside the fic the character of spider-man always does what he does because he's a good person, and he wants to help people. I think JK kept that sweet part of him inside for such a long time, and instead of it dying away it just hid for a while. and now that he's around Tae he's remembering what it feels like to be with someone and it's like the sun came out from behind the clouds. I think it also helps that Tae is so patient with him and made him comfortable so quick, bc then JK gets to water that little sweetness plant inside him and let it flourish more and more each day

2837,if any of your tks had instagram what would their feed look like🤔,"ooooo ok ik people usually search up a bunch of pictures on instagram and stuff but I do not have the time for it so here's just a few ideas off the top of my head



CY JK: pretty much entirely Tae, later on it's Tae and the kids, a few with family and friends here and there, the only time he posts pictures of himself is when he's taking cringe dad selfies at comic-con



CY Tae: posts a lot of pictures of the kids too, also a TON of fashion stuff and likes to document his best outfits



NOY JK: lollll I feel like his old stuff from high school would be like edge-lord supreme like selfies of him in the dark with a blunt trying to look so cool and when he tries to delete them he can't remember the password for the acct so they're on the app forever. Tae for sure makes him a new one once they get together and he posts pics of them and a bunch of his neices



NOY Tae: also couple pics, fun selfies at tourist spots from the places they play on tour



IYLM JK: pre-Tae his profile has exactly 2 pictures both from his freshman year of high school but post-Tae he takes a lot of artsy photos. definitely soft-launches Tae as his boyfriend before they make anything super public



IYLM Tae: also soft-launches JK, lots of partnership posts with fashion brands and more casual pics from his travels. for sure has fans making photocards of his posts



IYLM Jin, Joon, and Yoongi: they don't have instagram - Jin bc he doesn't have time, Joon bc he doesn't know how, Yoongi bc he doesn't want the government accessing his personal information



IYLM Jimin: hasn't updated it since he started dating Yoongi. but every photo is the absolute cuntiest thing on planet earth, a post of him and Tae holds the record as the 5th-most liked post on instagram



IYLM Hobi: I think a lot like irl Hobi's insta tbh, for sure has like 2 million followers



Skillshare: JK posts a lot of his art, Bam, and Tae (not necessarily in that order) and Tae posts a lot of nothing bc he overthinks his captions and can't settle on anything good enough



DNA JK: no instagram but there is an account called 'spideyheart' with 0 followers that was active around the years 2014-2016 and posted screenshots of the most cringey romantic Pinterest quotes



DNA Tae: hasn't updated since 2016



Losin' End: these jokers don't have instagram



Chingu: Tae's is on private, only a few posts and a few followers bc he forgets to update it for months at a a time



Chingu JK...well, he had an instagram. a lot of blurry peace-sign selfies and cryptic memes before his account got disabled for 'bot-like behavior' bc he was posting so many times a day","22 May, 2023","{'cy', 'noy', 'iylm', 'dna', 'headcanon', 'skillshare', 'chingu'}",1317986470,

2764,"it's iylm namjin missing hours </3 they're always on my mind tbh but how's walden? have namjin gone on any dates recently? actually do they strive to have date night every week? I imagine jin would have brought joon flowers one day after passing by a store full of spring flowers, and after giving them to him, he would arrange them in a vase himself bc joonie would likely elbow or drop it accidentally","Walden is living life!! I mentioned a while back that Jin had hopes of entering him into a dog show because he's so well-trained, but thanks to Namjoon's secret efforts he's free of that potential torment PLUS he's allowed on the couch when Jin isn't how.



Date night - supposed to be a weekly thing, but with how busy they are it's usually a two-weeks-to-once-a-month kind of thing. But they always take at least a few hours of quiet time to themselves on the weekend, usually on a walk with Walden.



FLOWERS LOL so I do firmly believe that Jin is the flower buyer in the relationship, but since it's canon Joon is allergic to flowers he only gets them to put in Tae's room. (It's canon to me that he still buys fresh ones every week, even after Tae moves out). Joon is a poem/letter guy, and then Jin usually says I love you with food and cleaning and all that jazz. But I do think for Joon's birthday one year he has a 'flower' bouquet made out of pages from one of Namjoon's favorite poetry books.","08 May, 2023",{'iylm'},1315981668,

2746,What is CY Taekook’s fav Star Wars movie? Have they watched Mandalorian? What is Tae’s opinion on Grogu?,"yes it's canon they've watched mando!! I think it's one of the halloween chapters I mention it LOL



Grogu...



I think Tae would be very...lukewarm towards Grogu.

like JK would be hyped when the show came out bc FINALLY something for them to watch together and he just knows Tae's going to love Grogu because he's adorable. cut to them watching it and Tae gets so confused about the concept of everyone calling him 'Baby Yoda' and every episode he's like 'wait so that's Yoda? I thought this was after Yoda?' and JK is left to bang his head on the coffee table with all thoughts of cuteness forgotten.



ok favorite movies...



I think Tae would like A New Hope because plot-wise it's the easiest for him to follow.



now Jungkook.



Jungkook is a prequels TRUTHER.



He loved them when they came out and he loves them now, and if anyone has a bad word to say about the acting or the script or the plot he whips out his level 100000 knowledge and demolishes their arguments. Also firm believer that CY JK is an Anakin Skywalker kinnie he loves that man with all his heart and for SURE Anakin was his first boy crush. if he's acting pretentious he'll say his favorite piece of star wars media is Clone Wars, but if you press him to actually name a movie he'll say Revenge of the Sith (though Attack of the Clones is a close second). cries every time he watches the battle on Mustafar and gets full-body shivers when he sees Anakin become Darth Vader","05 May, 2023",{'cy'},1315985732,

2744,you wrote cy while you were getting into bts?? THATS CRAZY but anyways..so like what was your “yeah i’m gonna have to check them out” moment with bts?,"yes I did!! I've known about BTS since probably like 2016ish? my brother was big into kpop (Jimin bias) before I was and so I knew them by default. and I distinctly remember watching one of those 'rm being done with bts' compilations with him and we died over the 'I like hamburger...AND SPRITE' thing. and we'd always randomly yell 'and sprite' at each other when we ordered food and stuff and I was always like oh yeah the sprite guy...



anyway I've been a casual kpop listener for a while but didn't know too much about the actual bands but around the time they released dynamite we showed it to my parents for some reason? I don't even remember why but after that I was like hmmmm...the sprite guy...let me find that video again...and then I fell into it from there



so then for Calendar by that point I had written my first fanfic (for another fandom that's really small and source material is limited) but I was almost finished with that, and I found I really really really liked writing fanfic, so when I looked up BTS fics and didn't really find anything I liked off the bat for tk I figured I should just write my own which is how we ended up with Calendar.

Suga as CY Yoongi: say what you will but that man loves a good time with his friends and I think he has the most stereotypical Yoongi/Suga from BTS traits bc I was writing Calendar even as I was getting into BTS (bc I'm a psycho) so that's what I ended up basing the characters on



Agust D as IYLM Yoongi: yeah ik he's a gentle hardware man but also??? he has hidden depths and this one just clicks for me I can't explain it



Min Yoongi: DNA - all my man does is drink and play music and you know what? that's all he needs to do I support Min Yoongi rights

ok well I've always thought that neither of them really have parents (hence why JK has to stay with them after his own parents die) but I imagine namjoon would have like a weird extended family they never really talked to except on holidays. and then I think jin would be pretty much on his own except for that one great-aunt I mentioned and more than half the time she's busy getting her freak on in the nursing home (as they do 😏) plus she lives pretty far so he doesn't see her that much.



SO



for their second (SECOND) date, namjoon invites jin to have Thanksgiving with him and his sister and their family, and of course it's terrible and there's some crazy uncle that gets in a screaming match with the grandfather and all that, but in the end jin's so happy to spend Thanksgiving with other people he doesn't even care. and afterwards namjoon asks him to spend Christmas together, and New Year's, and Valentine's Day, and pretty much every holiday after that.

I'd say plotwise (like in terms of mapping out their lives together and seeing where they end up) you can read through part 5 and be fine. Part 6 is just parts 1-5 put in chronological order, and then for part 7 it's just a bunch of one shots I've done. a lot of them are either during holidays/birthdays or just random stuff people asked me to write, so probably won't be 'finished' any time soon. but if you get to the most recent chapter it's not like it's ending on a cliffhanger or anything. hope all that made sense LOL","29 Apr, 2023",{'cy'},1315230679,

It's...beautiful, painful, and an intimate study on the human condition. I think you'd enjoy it. It's called Hello, Beautiful. :) It's kinda based loosely on the idea of Little Women which made me think of IYLM bc there's an instance in the book where one of the sister's says ""I feel like Beth today"" to give their other sister an idea of how they feel...AND I JUST STARED TEARING UP BC YOU RUINED ME WITH IYLM FOR LIFE AND I LOVE YOU FOR IT>

also!!!! i wanted to suggest this so i hope its okay for me to ask but have you ever considered a chapter where tk adopt a pet? it can literally be any pet even a fish (theyre so underrated) i just think itd be super cute </3 or if not a pet then maybe either jitae or jolie could bring home a class pet ? yknow :-0 how some school classes have like idk a hamster as a class pet and every student gets to take it home for a few days ? 



idk either way i think itd be super cute :D ofc u dont have to do this i just thought itd be a nice idea

namjin: I think they tried a lot of the classics (BDSM, bondage, roleplay, dirty talk) all with disastrous results. DISASTROUS. I'm talking they can't even look at each other for 2 business days because they're both so embarrassed. and then they finally agree that what turns them on, at the end of the day, is Jin wearing his silk pajamas and Namjoon whispering his pretty poetry, and they've been happy with that ever since.



yoonmin: what HAVEN'T they done. they strike me as a big roleplay couple, like, prime housewife x handyman stuff. I think their most ambitious crossover would be millionaire's son F1 driver x escaped felon who conned his way onto the pit crew and they get down in Yoongi's truck



taekook: they definitely filmed themselves more than once. I think they call each other when they're traveling apart for work and watch it together. that and they've done some light bondage - JK doesn't know all those sailor knots for nothing

2634,Hi hi 🥰 hey just curious that you like TK as a ship or just like inspiration for writing?,"mostly the latter, I think wholeheartedly shipping fictional characters is fine but with real people it's a little different. I don't know TK as real people so I'm not gonna assume things about their relationship IRL. I think it's okay to ship real life people and enjoy seeing them together but only up to a point - if you're berating that person for not being what your idealized of them and their relationship is, or berating other people for having another version they prefer, you're taking it too far. writing RPF is a gray area because they're real, so when people read fictional characters with their name sometimes it gets mixed up. but I think as an RPF writer we have a responsibility to understand the difference between what's fiction and what's real life, and for me TK is fiction. whether or not they are in a relationship in real life, it's not something that's been made public so it's not for me to dictate to them or other fans of BTS if that's the truth. we don't know anything, and at the end of the day its their lives and they can live however they want. so I guess this is all to say that I'm fine with people shipping IRL TK as long as they aren't harmful about it, but personally I'm writing from a fictional perspective.

2604,wait now i need to know ur jks reactions to elle V,"CY: creams his jeans (actually. on the spot.)



NOY: he's finding those magazines, he's tearing them out of people's hands, he's ripping them up, that's HIS Tae no one else gets to see. he's fawning over the 20+ copies he's stolen for himself. he's devastated over no bread cheeks and coming up with a plan to get them back ASAP. an all-around menace to society during this time, please understand.



IYLM: Tae teases him and asks if he's the one who needs a pacemaker bc he goes super pale and can't really form a sentence for several minutes. definitely gets overly shy when someone mentions 'his boyfriend' and the new magazine covers



Skillshare: attempts to stay strong in public but folds like a wet cardboard box when they're at home. showers Tae with praise just the way he likes after pretending to be upset over sharing himself with the whole entire WORLD, jagiya



DNA: oh, poor poor JK. he's already in so deep and this makes it even worse. though I think his primary reaction would be to reassure Tae that it looks awesome and he shouldn't be shy about how handsome he is



Losin' End: I like to imagine it's a shoot Tae did when he was younger that JK stumbles upon. they spend an evening on the couch together and Tae walks him through every picture reminiscing. it's actually very wholesome considering how much he thinks about Tae's nipples



chingu: he passed out from the shock and smacked his head on the corner of his desk, Tae had to take him to the hospital and now he's got a concussion. keeps looking at it on his computer during work hours and frantically clicking out of it when Taehyung walks in. orders a copy but he's too embarrassed to open it.","30 Mar, 2023","{'cy', 'noy', 'iylm', 'dna', 'headcanon', 'skillshare', 'chingu'}",1311161092,
2603,how would the cy and iylm boys react to like crazy?,"excellent question.



CY: they're teasing the shit out of him over it and how he's being so 'sexy' but then the second he leaves they're all freaking out over how he's being so SEXY



IYLM: spamming the TL with reminders to stream, making t-shirts, burning CDs and handing them out on the street","30 Mar, 2023","{'iylm', 'cy'}",1310707376,

2600,how would your taes react to jk x ck ??,"ooooo ok



CY: agrees with everyone when they talk about hot he is but is smiling to himself bc he's the only one that knows JK was wearing Iron Man socks during the shoot for a confidence boost



NOY: blushing x100000000, can't talk, peeks through his fingers at it bc it's just so hot and he's going to melt



IYLM: the one who convinced him to do it in the first place and was on set the whole time, but still absolutely blown away and flustered when he sees the final pictures



Skillshare: selfie in front of the billboard, stops people on the street and says 'that's my boyfriend'



DNA: also sees the billboard, smacks into a lightpole bc he's gaping at it so hard. for sure blushing like crazy the next day looking at him in the office



Losin' End: makes JK put on the same show for him at home



chingu: looks at it and agrees it looks good FROM A PROFESSIONAL STANDPOINT IT'S A GOOD BUSINESS DECISION AND SMART FOR BRANDING (then when he's alone he sneaks another look because damn, he did not realize his boss was that cut under those baggy clothes)","30 Mar, 2023","{'cy', 'noy', 'iylm', 'dna', 'headcanon', 'skillshare', 'chingu'}",1310869159,

2480,andrew spidey or tom holland spidey?,"ANDREWWWWWWWWWW



I think he really embodies my favorite parts of spidey, with how he's just a broke loser LOL



but actually I think from the source material, he's closest to the the 90s/2000s comics (which are my favorite). I do like Tobey spidey and I think his origin story is the most well done, I also think his movies have the best plots (but for sure the worst romance). He definitely reminds me more of the original spiderman comics where Peter Parker was a full blown nerd with a bowtie. I've always thought Tobey was a better Peter but Andrew was a better Spider-Man



I DO like tom holland's spidey, I think he's awesome, but only in the context of marvel. with the last movie they pulled away from him being so reliant on other marvel franchise characters (but at the same time they just pulled in everyone from the other spidey movies). idk, I think he's good, but his spider-man is something really different from the other two in that he doesn't really feel like spider-man to me in the same way they do? Like I can't really picture him wise-cracking while punching a bank robber (technically he does but it just doesn't hit the same way). I've seen other people talk about this before but one of the main things is that he gets SO much help from other people which I feel like takes away from the essence of spiderman and so much of his character. it's refreshing to watch them take him in a new direction from the others (like the whole student/mentor thing with Iron Man) but I'm worried at this point they're relying too heavily on other characters and nostalgia we already know instead of coming up with new material.



TLDR: andrew is my favorite bc to me he feels the most like spider-man, idc that his movie plots were absolute dogshit","24 Feb, 2023",set(),1307756415,

2429,"Hello, I have a private acc so I'll write you here haha Sorry in advance for this ass-long message. 

Yesterday I found DNA and couldnt stop reading it till the end. To say I love its an understatement, I seriously think its one of my favorites already, and its a bit of surprising for me to say that bc I dont focus for too long, so I try to avoid long fics BUT I really appreciate whatever was the reason I decided start your fic, now I cant stop thinking about it. I love the characters so much, and your writing is exquisite. Everything, every word is so nicely written I had to stop every now and then and praise you in my mind. I write too -or try to- so I'm really impressed. I cried twice in a span of 8 hours lol First it was with kookjin, Jin is a precious human being that I want to protect. I'm so thankful Jungkook has him. His relationship is something I cheris more than you can imagine. Another thing that made me cry is how much Jungkook loves Taehyung, and how much Taehyung loves Spider-man even now. It makes me emotional that for Jungkook its always been Taehyung, only him, love it.

Taehyung is so human, so strong, so brave, I admire him a lot. I want to hug him badly. I think I have a special thing for him because he reminds me of myself. Im not brave but I also wanted to be a surgeon you know? I never told this to anyone but hey its not a big deal, I wanted to be a surgeon, but for a few years now my hands dont stay still, its not very noticeable, but I always try to not take photos haha I thought I'd get over it at first, eventually, but when at my anatomy test two months ago the heart in my hand trembled so much it seemed almost alive, I knew for sure I would never be a surgeon. Its okay, I still want to be a doctor, but even so, its hard ig

Something similar is certainly not what I expected to find in this fic, but Im glad I did, it made me feel warm. 

This is already so long, but I wanted to thank you, and not for the last time, for writing this fic, I hope you can grasp my gratitude in this words. I totally love it, Im so invested, I really want to read more but I dont want to put pressure on you, take your sweet time and take care of yourself too. I'll patiently wait while I read more of your fics.

Hope I'm not making you uncomfortable with this, I just want you to know how your work had an impact on me. It has a lot of beautiful messages, you really did a excelent job.

And last but not least, my question: is Taehyung already suspicious? haha just kidding. He's so smart but I dont really know what to think and I want to find out the truth through the story. The real question is... do you have the story fully planned out yet? I mean, just out of curiosity. Or maybe you just go with the flow? (sorry if you already answered it before)

Well, sorry for taking so much of your time, and sorry for my english too. Im @ guk0997 on twitter, so if you see that user liking your posts, thats me. Dont judge me haha

Bye bye. Fighting 💖","tbh I've kept this in my inbox longer than I should've because coming back to read it has made me smile and almost cry several times. I've said before it really touches my heart when people tell me how my fic has affected them personally or helped them, especially since it really helps me to write them.



hearing you write how you feel about Tae, ahhh. my heart aches (in a good way). thank you for sharing your struggles with me and when I read what you wrote I really felt something in my chest and it made me so grateful to write a character that someone out there can relate to so specifically. you said he reminds you of yourself because he's so human, but then you said he's brave and you're not. honestly I think the bravest thing someone can do is be human. I think letting ourselves feel pain and feel it deeply is what makes us not only stronger but more empathetic. there's always something to be learned from being hurt, even if it's just that you can keep moving afterwards. 



on a lighter note, to answer your question yes I have it all planned! I didn't in the first few chapters (which is typical when I start a fic). I usually give myself about 3-4 chapters to play around and throw in ideas before I force myself sit down and outline (and come up with a realistic chapter count)

2417,"Hi I'm obsessed with chingu!! Loving it so far (as I love all your stories), thanks for writing!

Thanks for listening to ideas

My chingu ideas:



JK having to look after Tae in some capacity for once, maybe Tae is ill but JK is not aware and there's a call from Soojin cos she's running late and can't pick up Hyunjin from school, she knows JK calls Tae 'hyung' and by extension maybe they're close (not quite friends but can ask a favour) or maybe she's just desperate and justifies by thinking how many times has Tae helped JK outside of work so he can do this for Tae now so she takes a chance and asks if he can arrange a driver to pick up Hyunjin



JK didn't notice Tae wasn't in cos maybe  JK pulled one of his all nighters again and went home in the morning but he's back late afternoon thinking maybe Tae went out, and just as he notices that's when he gets the call from Soojin

So then he's like I'll pick up Hyunjin

He brings him home (Soojin tells him the code) and he sees Tae ill (maybe he peeks in his room to check after Hyunjin says daddy was sick), so he gets food for all of them

He sees Tae is out of it and helps him get cleaned up (but he's slightly grossed out by it but also slightly turned on cos he gets to see some skin but not in a creepy way)

Also we get some more scenes of just Hyunjin and JK being hilarious and cute



Maybe Tae comes out of his room looking a mess (cos he heard Hyunjin talking to someone, he thinks hes hearing JK but also thinks he's delirious 😆) and he's slightly embarrassed cos he never looks anything less than well put together for work and therefore, in front of JK (like JK has never even seen him in casual clothes!)



ok sorry I'll stop now 😂","ahhhh I love this!! I feel like a lot of the stuff you touched on I really want to have in the story, for sure the part about JK seeing Tae out of his work element/being a normal guy at home","15 Feb, 2023",{'chingu'},1306702249,

CY - Jin canonically walked in on Yoongi & Jimin at least once, it was more traumatic for Yoongi than him



NOY - Tae, Joon, and Hobi have all walked in on each other several times in their studio's back room so they started making a schedule and everything's gone smoothly since then



IYLM - Joon walked in on Hobi so many times their freshman year of college Hobi would move his desk in front of the door to keep him from getting into the room



skillshare - back when Tae lived in Canada he walked in on his roommate having sex in the living room and sat at the kitchen table eating dinner for twenty minutes before either of them realized the other was there



DNA - JK for sure walked in on namjin when he was a kid like 10 times, but Joon would always tell him they were checking for bed bugs



Losin' End - I think when people walk in on Tae he asks if they want to join in



chingu - JK's been walked in on by every assistant but Tae bc he never remembers to shut his door","18 Jan, 2023","{'cy', 'noy', 'iylm', 'dna', 'headcanon', 'skillshare', 'chingu'}",1304856383,

2288,"Hello!!! So I was thinking about your fav characters to write thread and how you feel like NOY and IYLM Tae don’t have enough agency because of their softness and stuff and I won’t try to change any opinion on that but it made me realize you might not know how much IYLM and DNA Tae are like,,, so amazing!!!! I’m disabled both physically and mentally and sometimes while reading I wonder if you’re disabled yourself because??? They’re so perfect?? Just the way you capture with IYLM that want to be both independent and fear of not having someone to catch you when you inevitably fall is so good to read and it makes me so happy because it’s not talked about a lot and the way that jinkook treat DNA Tae and his want to ignore his own disability like?:!/?/$)3 that’s so!!!!!! Ugh!! Can’t even put into words how amazing these guys are of sick and disabled representation and I just had to say something because it would be a crime for you to continue to not know that they feel like a part of me being put into words so thank you","crap, I think what I meant to say but didn't explain well enough is that I think they DO have agency, but finding the right way to write it was difficult, if that makes sense. since they're softer characters I had to play around with how they handle conflict since they wouldn't go the obvious route of yelling or fighting about it, etc. But at the end of the day I'm happy with how IYLM and NOY Tae both turned out :)



but also for the other part of this, thank you!! I was nervous to write them because I'm not disabled, and I don't have a lot of experience with disability in my personal life, so it was a lot of googling and guesswork. I'm always worried about writing something I don't know much about because I want to treat it as respectfully as I can, so reading a comment like this both puts my mind at ease and warms my heart.

IYLM is the sunrise couple, they for sure like to go out on JK's boat and watch it in the morning and then read when it gets light enough



NOY are stargazers. I can picture them lying in their garden Tae eventually grows to watch the stars at night before making their sleepy way back to bed



skillshare is tough, I think they're less of sunrise vs. sunset and more rain vs. shine. they thrive in the rain babyyyy (which is good because they live in London LOL) I think JK gets his best work done when it's raining and that's usually when Tae will mellow out. I picture them lounging on the couch together and not saying much but just enjoying being close to each other



DNA is clearly the moon couple. their sappy high-school asses loved watching the moon and you know Tae had so many dorky facts about the moon cycle and JK ate them up every time.



Losin' End is the pre-dawn couple. like that time when the sun hasn't made it over the horizon yet but the sky is starting to lighten. imagining them moving around the kitchen in the early early morning bc neither of them can sleep and just watching the sky outside the window

okay 1, perseverance is key. I applied to so many jobs and did so many interviews before I found the one I'm at now. I'd say if you have connections absolutely use them, it really helps to have your foot in the door somewhere especially right now when so many people are going for the same jobs because we're all pretty much in the same boat. even if you don't have connections to something though don't be too discouraged (my job was from a random linkedin posting and I didn't know anyone at the company) but just know it most likely won't be the first one you apply and interview for (it might not even be the twentieth unfortunately) but eventually something will come. 



2. most jobs especially with marketing really only care about how you are as a person/what you bring to the table as a worker. a lot of marketing jobs can only be taught by actually working that job so as long as you've shown that you're capable and willing to learn that makes you a much more attractive hire regardless of where you did or didn't intern.



3. ask questions in interviews!! most people say this bc it makes you look like better-prepared and more invested (which is true) but also it's for you to sus out if it's a good company or not. I have a lot of friends who took jobs that were offered very quickly and now they're job hunting again bc their company sucks. take the time to do some research and ask questions/learn for things to watch out for. it's not worth rushing to find a job (if you can afford to wait at least) if it's going to turn out poorly.","02 Jan, 2023",set(),1302865608,

I’m not sending this with malicious intent or like “hate” I just want to maybe talk about it is all!","This is actually something I’ve thought about soooo much since posting those. Truthfully fatphobia is something I don’t have much knowledge about or experience with and it’s a lot of my own personal thought processes that end up with me writing something and thinking “okay that makes sense for the character to say or think that because xyz” whether it’s because of them reacting in a situation or how they’d act bc of their personality? like for skillshare id think ‘oh JK is obsessed with fitness so when he eats sugary foods he’s annoyed about it’. I’ve always tried to portray my characters as flawed and show the parts of them that aren’t good, because that feels more real to me. It’s not my intention to make people upset or hurt their feelings, and honestly I didn’t really even think about any of that as something that would upset people.

That being said just bc I didn’t flag those moments as upsetting doesn’t mean they aren’t. I think for me a lot of those inner monologues come from my relationship with food and body image and how it was portrayed when I was growing up. Do I think it’s bad for someone to be fat? Of course not. Do I think it’s bad for me to be fat? A deeper question. I think in general the way I’ve been taught to categorize and interpret some of the scenarios I’ve written in my fics are to have those negative reactions and thoughts. So I’ll write the scene, write the internal monologue, and think oh well it’s fine, bc he’s only thinking it about himself. And then any time someone makes one of those statements to someone else it’s always in a negative light/an insult designed to put us off the character. Idk if this makes sense and I don’t even know if it’s an explanation? Like I said it’s a lot of my own personal bias I’ve been reflecting on lately and trying more consciously to keep out of my work.

2069,okay okay i know its just a fic BUT HOW CAN TAE NOT RECOGNISE JUNGKOOKS VOICE IN DNA,Hahaha fair point BUT whenever JK sees him at school he’s always like 1 word answers and brooding sad boy so Tae doesn’t really hear him talk as JK all that much. And then later on I’d imagine it’s hard to remember the way someone’s voice sounds after like 8 years. Also idk I feel like the mask would make it harder for him to connect that it’s Jungkook?

funny is the December CY chapter where Tae wears the sexy anime cosplay. I was cracking myself up with that one and it was so much fun to write, especially because I don't normally write CY Tae as dramatic as I do JK so it was fun to have him Stressed



sad is the CY chapter (March, I think?) when Tae talks with his dad on the porch about his future. idk something about that just felt very...poignant, maybe? my parents aren't anything like that so it wasn't really therapeutic or anything, but I feel like in the sense of writing Tae it was a good chapter to get out. I think it sheds so much light on their relationship and how complicated it is, and it just makes my heart go out to both of them. the part where he says 'please don't be disappointed' just always stuck right in my chest and I still think about it sometimes. there's something so sad and so hopeful about it and idk I just feel like that chapter was one I felt really content with. I think too maybe it was the first I wrote that felt truly deep to me in a personal sense, for whatever reason. idk I just really loved writing it. I know I've said it before that I relate to CY JK a lot and he'll always be my ride or die as my first character, but I have so much love for CY Tae.

2042,Hardest part about writing losin end!,"ooooooo let me think...I guess maybe the tone? a lot of my characters (my JKs at least) are usually pretty dramatic and this one has his moments, but even his internal monologue is a lot more subdued. so it's a challenge to write a scene or moment and give it the right feeling without resorting to hyperbole (which has its place and is super fun to use, as we can see with CY JK), but I feel like with Losin' End it's almost that 'show don't tell' thing where I have to put emphasis on these small little moments. the whole fic feels a lot smaller, but in a good way. like if my other fics are movies and tv shows this feels like a stage play

2027,Which advice would you give to a person who is approaching writing for the first time? 👀,"first and foremost, over E V E R Y T H I N G:

write what you want to write. ik it sounds kind of stupid but especially if you want to do stuff like fanfic/as something fun and creative, write stuff you WANT to write. the amount of times I'll open up a word doc of something I ""should"" be working on and then just stare at it before closing it again is astounding. and then I'll work on something that's completely different and it'll be awesome. it's a very chaotic approach but for me at least that's key to keeping writing fun and it preserves my creative process. I've found too that it becomes so much less overwhelming when I'm working on an update and I see that 4 weeks ago I already wrote part of it bc I was in the mood to. mood/being in that headspace is so important for writing and even if it's not what you're 'supposed' to be doing or what people are asking for it's going to be rewarding for /you/. at the end of the day you're writing for yourself, so write what makes you happy



second.

sometimes you do have to write things you DON'T want to, and it sucks. or sometimes you have writer's block, or you just would rather do anything else but write, etc. my trick for this is usually just to make myself write 5 sentences. can be dialogue, can be prose, but either way just write 5 sentences of whatever the next part is supposed to be. if I finish that and I really can't do any more, I'll take a break and then come back and write 5 more. but usually that's enough for me to get into the groove, and then I have if not the motivation at least the momentum to push through. that's another tip, just KEEP writing. even if you're thinking while you're doing it that it sucks, at least just keep putting words down, and then at the end you can make changes.



third.

thinking about writing and the physical act of writing are very different things. this goes with the above point, thinking about a scene or moment or line is easy. actually writing it out sucks sometimes, and you have to trick your brain into that mindset of ""okay, this is the most amazing and romantic scene and now I have to turn myself into a robot to communicate it to the computer."" sometimes the act of writing sucks because it can be so mechanical, but if you can push through that it gets easier to reconcile the two. 



fourth.

everyone has different styles and different methods. yours will be unique to you. I still read stuff that blows my mind and makes me wish I wrote differently, but at the end of the day my style is my own and brings a different perspective. we've all got something to say and we all have our own way of saying it. this is definitely something that develops over time, but the more you write the clearer it'll become. I would say an easy way for me to get down the cadence and style of my own writing is just re-reading things I've already written.



fifth.

whatever you write, post it! even if you don't think it's good, I guarantee someone else will.



best of luck!","04 Dec, 2022",set(),1300166250,

1995,did you find it hard to write new calendar chapters because you'd already written so much like for example I feel like it would be hard to suddenly write a chapter of them getting a dog or something because you've already written later chapters where they don't have a dog💀 idk if this makes sense,"yes!! sometimes it's just serendipity and works out, like here's an example: I was going to have Tae be Appa and then have JK be Dad but LITERALLY JUST because I wanted JK to make the 'daddy' joke in that first chapter the kids are intro'd I wrote that bit about Ji-tae calling JK appa first. and then when I went to write that chapter I realized I was able to write it from another angle bc it was from Tae's perspective. so that too lets me get away with a lot of stuff, especially if its close to another time I've already written about. but I think the beauty of calendar too is that I write a lot about their mundane day-to-day stuff, so one chapter won't always have an impact on another. so then that lets me make up these other moments in time that are completely different, and I don't have to worry as much about things overlapping.



but I do have a ridiculously and poorly made timeline I refer to a lot, and with the ages in particular I have an actual excel sheet that lets me figure out how old everyone should be at a given time 😂","22 Nov, 2022",{'cy'},1299062040,

I really just love them a whole bunch, can't wait to see how the story keeps unfolding 🥹🥹🥹",ahhhh thank you!! I was really worried it wouldn't come off right but I think I managed it. yes idk what it is about them in particular but they do feel so different. maybe out of everyone I've written they feel the realest--and I think out of everyone I've written they're the loneliest. so it's really lovely to write (and read I guess) about them finding one another after so much time alone.

I was truly in awestruck the whole time, at how well it was built, at how the other's characters story were also important part of the story too, at taehyungie angel being the babiest of baby bears and so resilient, as well as Joonie, of course. And Jinie and Jungkook, I believe those were the characters I connected and emphatize with even more, 'cause you do emphatize with all of them, but god, these two and their ways and things they go through got me so emotional all the time, especially Jungkook. Anyways, I just really wanted to let you know that and to tell you that your writting is amazing, I am very grateful you wrote and share such precious story with us. I was even sad to end it and holding back on those last chapters, 'cause I was emotionally attached and the story got me through so many dense days, so thank you really, with all my heart. It made me smile a lot to see there might be a second part, will be looking foward to that so eagerly, but of course, you can always take your time, no rush at all, don't mean anything of the sort to put pressure on you, I value writer's work but mostly the amazing minds behind said beautiful works. Thank you again and if you see the edit, I hope you like it, did my best to do justice to the many beautiful details of this story but was limited to Twitter's 2:20 minutes so it's not much, but I really hope you like it! Have a lovely day and thank you, thank you, thank you!","hiii!!! i've watched that edit not kidding at least 50 times by now.

Thank you isn't even really enough to tell you how special it is that you read my story and poured your effort into making something that was not only beautiful but also so meaningful and captured the fic so perfectly! from watching it even just the first time I could immediately tell you knew the story; all the clips you put in to hit the different story beats and the overall mood/tone of it all, ugh it was so amazing and I'm like...speechless that someone liked my story that much to make that. sending you all the love in my heart","15 Nov, 2022",{'iylm'},1298257920,

1889,omg hi one last stop anon here !!! i’d love to hear what you think of it. i know the beginning is a bit slow but the whole story and little found family they form rly makes it my comfort book 💗,"hi, thank you so much for the rec!!  I really want to get into more wlw books so this was a really good rec (as much as I love writing tk I feel like there's a lack of wlw media to engage with--at least a lack of visibility for it--and it for sure inspired me to at least explore the genre more, if not contribute to it myself)



the book...hmm. Loved the found family trope, I thought it was so well done and the way they just adopt August the second they see her is so sweet and wonderful. I liked the writing, I see what people mean when they say that author writes like she's writing fanfic, and there were some really touching lines. I was torn about how descriptive/abstract she was about things, because on the one hand it was really beautiful and other times I was like LADY THIS BOOK IS 400 PAGES WE DON'T NEED ANOTHER MONOLOGUE ABOUT NEW YORK. and yet I do very similar things in my writing to maybe it was just me feeling strange seeing it somewhere else



Jane and August deserve eternal happiness forever, even if I didn't totally connect with them. I think for Jane she unfortunately felt a little one note only because she's literally trapped on the subway LOL so we don't really get to see her in any other situation. I feel like if the author wrote a sequel about them going to see her family I'd read the SHIT out of it.



August. Oh August.

I wanted to like her so bad, and at the end I did, but good lord it was hard at the start. idk why but at the start she just felt very pretentious to me? I can't really put my finger on why I disliked her but at the same time I feel like they adequately explained why she is the way she is. and in the end she won me over once she started opening up and letting other people in (loved that she was like so Niko's a psychic...okay yes I am at peace with this)



although another thing I was thinking about when I was trying to decide why she bothered me was that if she was a guy character it'd be easy to be like oh, he's a loner, that's his deal and move on with the story. she reminds me of like 5000 fanfic guy protagonists (kind of a mix of edgy loner and shy nerd, haha) that I've read and been fine with. so internalized misogyny sucks and that was fun to reckon with. let's pour one out for being a girl raised in a man's world



though that was definitely a reason I ended up loving the book even if I didn't always like the characters. the love story was v cute and wlw deserves to have a healthy scoop of all the romance tropes, and yes I died at the 'kissing for research' and every time August admitted to herself she was in 'terrible, dumbass love'","20 Oct, 2022",set(),1295604023,

1744,what words of advice would Cy taekook give to all your other taekooks?,"Nearness of You: CY JK would for suuuuuure tell JK to cry more. also probably to be kinder to himself when his emotions get out of control. I think CY Tae would tell Tae it's good to stand up for yourself even if it feels scary, and the more you do it the easier it gets. and then they'd probably say relationship-wise that leaning on one another isn't a one-at-a-time thing, if someone's struggling there's room for the other's problems as well. I feel like they'd tell them that their love is strong enough to support both of them at once, even if it feels like they're spread too thin



IYLM: awwww they would have so many things to say to them and they'd for sure spend the first half hour reminiscing about when they were young like that. I think CY JK would have some very lovely things to say about his relationship with Jin (and probably die when he finds out IYLM Jin is a bajillionaire) and urge JK to not take it for granted even though Jin is sometimes the most annoying person ever (which JK refuses to agree with). CY Tae would probably give Tae advice on how to draw JK out of his shell and make him comfortable when he gets shy around others. then he'd have some really good perspective on life/career purpose and how to find something fulfilling/something to take pride in. relationship-wise for them CY taekook would say to be patient with one another because they're both young and have a lot of growing to do as a couple and on their own. so they'd tell them to be understanding and to always communicate



skillshare: (I feel like at first CY JK would be appalled at how JK treats Tae 😂) but in all seriousness he'd tell JK to try and be a little more vulnerable sometimes even though it's hard to put yourself out there. he'd also probably tell him he's extremely talented and should never apologize for it the way CY JK used to. CY Tae for sure would give Tae tips on how to not be so spacy all the time and learn how to be mindful of others feelings even when you're a million miles away in your head. (he'd also recommend a quality anti-frizz hair care product and some unsolicited but much needed fashion advice). then relationship-wise they'd tell skillshare to sit down and think about how they show each other love (since it's pretty unconventional) and work on recognizing those signs, so even when they bicker they know underneath there's a strong foundation. that and they'd definitely let them in on their 'don't go to bed angry' rule.

for ones that inspired the way I write, I think I'm usually more inspired by movies or imagery, bc of the way I write I tend to picture everything in my head so imagining it play out like a film makes it easier to put into words. big into writing something in such a way that it'll make me 'feel' a kind of way, if that makes sense and I try to have that be different for each fic. almost like an aesthetic but something more internal. idk what I'm saying anymore","30 Aug, 2022",set(),1289944014,

1. Tae, how has your modeling career been since after the pacemaker has been placed? 

2. Jin how do you and Joon find time to spend together now that you are CEO?

4. Yoongi and Jimin any plans for kiddos in the future","1. good! I don’t feel as sick anymore so it’s a lot easier. Although now that I’m not so tired I’m noticing I get more annoyed about stuff than I used to but I think that’s a good thing. No one tells me to get a nose job anymore after I snapped one time (oops 😁)

2. My calendar has a block of time scheduled every evening where no one’s allowed to contact me unless it’s a true emergency. Felt really stupid and depressing to have to do at first but it really helps. That and every other Friday I’ll work remotely so we can go somewhere for the weekend if we want

3. No one yet, but Jimin got me set up on one of the apps! Kind of terrifying and I feel very much like the old guy out but I figured I should at least put myself out there!

Also I just started the tv show they made of it and it’s really good so far

2. A Little Life: seriously only read this if your mental health is at peak level and you’ve familiarized yourself with all the trigger warnings, it’s not a light read at all. That being said it’s beautiful and has some of the most complex and loving and important relationships between characters I’ve read

3. Olympus, Texas: picked this up on a whim from the Barnes and noble mythology table and it was really good. Much shorter than the other two LOL but it’s basically a retelling of the Roman gods if they were a family that lived on a cattle farm in Texas. Another character study and it really dives deep into these myths and stories by treating them as real life events (if that makes sense) and all in all it was a good read. Definitely nothing like Percy Jackson but food for thought nonetheless","20 Jul, 2022",{'cy'},1284785270,

I’d originally stayed away from it because I thought it’d be a real challenge for me to write (and it is) but I wanted to try at some point. For IYLM I think it was easier bc it drove the plot. I think also that sometimes smut scenes can reveal stuff about the characters/illustrate relationships and emotions in an interesting way, and without giving too much away I’m attempting to do something to that effect in the spideykoo fics so hopefully it turns out. I think the only pair I’d write smut for just because is probably calendar, since I’m so comfortable with their dynamic + I feel like we’ve seen so much of their lives it would feel just like another piece of their relationship (if that makes sense).

1511,"jhskf okay hang on, let me put my thoughts in a semi-coherent order aha- character development is so essential to me in literature bc part of the takeaway is rlly the behaviour and thought patterns of the characters. that analysis is so fascinating, not to mention everything I learn while reading about their experiences. and let me tell you, I've learnt a whole lot from CY - not just taekook, but everyone! you've written their dynamics and interactions with so much goodness and kindness and love as the foundation of every relationship. and yet, there's so much diversity. I love how fleshed-out your characters are with their personality quirks and their backgrounds. or how your writing poses all kinds of debates like which is more important in life - happiness or success (although I'm not phrasing it right, bc there's so much more to it). the growth of the characters is evident not only in the way their personality changes (like jungkook's confidence or taehyung's ability to deal with emotions and open up) but also in their outlook on life. then in the part they take in relationships too, like how jungkook used to freak out when sb started crying (even though he cries the most heh) but later became the most comforting person ever. my point is that it shows how people change, but also how they change in harmony with their loved ones to become a better version of themselves. it's inspiring and, of course it's a slice-of-life fic so maybe it's inevitable to explore their development, but I haven't read about such realistic characters before and so I'm impressed is all. well, not all bc I also care about them an unhealthy amount but you know

andd healthy, productive parenting? yes pls and thank you! it's so heartwarming to see bc the truth is some people don't realise how formative and crucial childhood is, especially the influence of the parents. like it has long-lasting effects on the child's mentality. so to see taekook be so incredibly responsible and caring makes me proud :] I didn't know I could love them more but then you created this precious loving family and they made a home in my heart

so yeah thinking back on tae and kook in their college days, what they've been through and then their adult life - there's so much positive change. so much to learn from and so much to thank you for. they're important to me, they're my comfort and inspiration, and that's only possible bc of the care and love you've put into creating them. so thank you and I'll always be here ♡","hello I've been having a very bad day but I finally sat and read this reply and it made everything so much better. seeing someone care enough about my work to make these really cool and insightful observations, and honestly they help me better reflect on my writing/improve how I write them in the future! this was so amazing seriously. thank you 😊😊","07 Jul, 2022",{'cy'},1283126134,

1481,"Hello, I hope you’re enjoying your break and living life to the fullest!! I just wanted to come here and say that i absolutely LOVE how you write children in your fics. The characterization is done so well, from Ji-tae to Jolie to Yuna to the little bit of Milo we saw. They just feel so real, which I know is hard thing to accomplish. Since we all already know and love the members so much, it doesn’t take much for us to love a new version of them in a fic. But kids are always new, and you’ve done such a good job that I care about them on their own and not just as extensions of like taekook relationship or smth. Also, this is kinda weird but all the kids you write are so “age appropriate” for lack of a better term. I can’t fault authors for making mistakes because I know not everyone has spent time with kids (especially really little ones) to fully understand how early development works, but since I have it’s a slight pet peeve of mine when like a 2 year old character is speaking fully formed sentences or a 6 year old needs their diaper changed (both of which i’ve read before). But when 11 year old ji-tae does something I just think “yeah seems like typical 11 year old behaviour” haha so yeah, to sum it up, your kid characters are always so well written and just another aspect of why I love your fics and your writing so so much!! I hope you have a great rest of your break!!","awww thank you!! this is actually something I always find myself second-guessing; I feel like anything under the age of 10 I'm like...is this what they would really sound like at this age? but this very nice compliment from you must mean I'm doing something right 😊 definitely tried to give each kid their own personality; it's a pet peeve of mine if OCs are introduced and they're really boring. especially kids, who are so fun and cute!! thank you for this it made my day 💖💖","30 Jun, 2022","{'noy', 'cy'}",1282351850,

1383,"ji tae chapter (or storyline?) about two months after he starts uni and he's in the campus library and this girl just sits beside him and starts talking about how much she likes the book he's reading (it's his fundamentals to corporate finance textbook) because it inspired her to switch her major to fucking astrophysics within the first week of the term, ji tae is confused bc hes maybe met this girl once in passing and she's far too pretty and smart to even notice him, anyways she just talks and talks about everything, he feels comfortable with her so he starts telling her stuff like how he has two dads, a younger sister, things about his major, what state he's from, and they're still there by the time the library is closing up, she gives him her number, ji leaves the library confused out of his mind bc what the fuck just happened, he missed out on study time but a pretty girl talked to him so it's whatever, he tells his family about it over facetime, and Jolie just blurts out ""she wants to date you for fucks sake are you blind"" jungkook just puts his head in his hands and says ""Jolie, please think before you talk"" and taehyung is like ""wait jungkook don't shush her, she's right, isn't it kind of like how we first met?"" causing both the kids to kinda perk up bc while they do know a bit about their parents met they don't know the whole story (I think taekook would've said they met through friends to simplify it) and then they get the entire story and it ends with Jolie crying laughing at jungkook going ""I'm here today because you wore a fire emblem shirt to get ben and Jerry's"" anyway the advice doesn't really matter bc by the end of their 3rd year they're living together, also let's make the girl Korean with two moms bc I want to see wlw and mlm solidarity within the in laws and when he brings her home the first time jolie goes ""i love her, you can keep her"" anyways in my head that's how ji tae ends up with a smart sexy wife, jolie is the best man? woman? at the wedding and the first part of her speech is ""I have no idea how you managed to bag her"" and taekook teach them about the cup being hit kiss thing and say they expect grandchildren within the next five years,, anyway I would love to see ji tae blossom in college and his adult life","OMG.

Honestly I have re-read and thought about that fic way too many times and I went through the authors tumblr and it was written clearly that it was supposed to be a happy ending and I can even imagine that but I still try to make up for missing parts. Everything was just at a very very terrible place when it was discontinued and my brain fails to think about how it could have possibly gotten better from that.



But yes, it was incredibly close to both of them and the parts with mental health and sexuality (if i remember correctly) came from their personal experiences which is what made it so so real despite it being a fictional disease entirely. :( 



But anyways, thank you for considering!



As for something else, I'm a sucker for heavy angst with a happy ending (surprise surprise) because I can't deal with MCD. So if you ever write something like that, I'll be here to inhale it practically. 💀💜",heavy angst is in the works I can promise you that! one of the fics I'm writing for the spideykoo fest is pretty angsty so be on the lookout for that at the start of May,"02 Apr, 2022",set(),1270521263,

“Eomma!” Jungkook protests, already blushing. Taehyung’s the one to squeeze his hand now.



“Well, eventually I hope to marry him.”



Jungkook feels his heartbeat pounding in his ears. What?



Taehyung squeezes his hand again, and he’s almost too dazed to squeeze back. Taehyung’s said that before, but it’s always been as a joke.



Hasn’t it?



“Is that before or after you become a senior partner?”



“Appa, please,” Jungkook protests. He’s still a bit numb, but he’s not going to let Taehyung get batted around like this, whether it’s lighthearted teasing or not.

759,Your advice for a writer struggling to finish a project?,Skip around!! If you’re struggling to keep doing one section switch to the next scene or paragraph; whenever I get stuck I just skip to the next part. If you’ve done everything else you can I’d say to just take it one sentence at a time even if it means writing one every half hour. And mostly importantly if you feel burnt out take a break!!

757,"So a while back you responded to a ask regarding doing commission work as long as you liked the prompts. 



now, I have one but I feel like it's just wrong to ask. I have been mulling over this since I read that ask of yours honestly. 



lThis may be controversial and just plain wrong (so feel free to call me out on it as well) but just let me know your thoughts on this?



So basically there's a fic that was discontinued years ago. Like 2018-19. It's very popular in the fandom till now. It's I bloomed for you by Meanie_Beanie and she and her sister came out with a sequel. Gave us 3 chapters (65-73k words) and then they discontinued it because of the amount of hate they got and the overwhelming amount of pressure they felt from the readers. They said they'd get back to it someday but it's been years and it doesn't seem like it will ever be continued. 



And it is truly understandable. But I just can't seem to let the fic go. I got into the fandom kinda recently and I have read like 1k+ fics till now but it just left such a huge impact on me. I can even envision how it would have ended and I wish I could write a little something personally for myself I guess to get closure but I can't really write. :(



I guess my question is, would you ever consider  writing a discontinued fic? Even if you don't post it anywhere on Ao3 or net in general as a wip. (Again, my fucking god this really feels very wrong but you are one those authors whose work just hit so hard and I have been thinking that if you or this one other author I know we're to complete it, you'd do it justice. It just feels so wrong because it is someone else'work but it has going on my head since a while. :/ )



The sequel had 3 parts out before it was discontinued and it was meant to have only 2-3 more parts to it. But alas, people can't shut the fuck up and they just. At the end of the day, people write this for free generally and we aren't owed shit, but a lot don't really get that I guess. 



But yeah, I know you have a lot of works going on currently so maybe later in the future. Would you ever consider it? 



(I'd completely understand if not as well..also I'm really sorry for rambling. This was all over the place but yeah. That's my ask.)","Hmmmm.

Okay I’ve given this a lot of thought + looked at the fic and I think my answer would be no. I don’t have a problem with writing a discontinued fic as long as I had the authors permission, but with this fic in particular it seems like that probably wouldn’t happen seeing as they stopped writing it  3 years ago + are private on twt. I think the other thing that’s stopping me is that it’s clearly a fic that’s really person to the author/rooted in real life experience so I don’t think I could do it justice no matter the quality of writing. Don’t think it’s wrong to ask per se but I think for me to write it (publicly or otherwise) would be. Happy to consider something else though!","02 Apr, 2022",set(),1270437629,

I think too his dad plays a big part in her return in that she’s allowed back in his life a lot more easily, though I feel like as sad as it is it’s in character for him as a lonely older guy who’s sad about how his family turned out.

But perspective and behaviour of others around me have changed so much that it makes me feel so uneasy. earlier i thought If i was the skinny one everything will be right in the world but now when I am its not it at all. im anxious about my body so much. weight loss didn't made me happy..... now i just don't want to be what i was before and keep starving myself time to time and i hate it so much. And seeing tae losing it like that just made me cry so so bad. can feel him so much. and I'm so glad he have someone like jk in his life(even though it fictional).

Every person deserves someone like jk in their life TT",Thank you for sharing this with me it really touched my heart ❤️ Knowing people relate to what I write means a lot bc I think that can open up honest conversations/thoughts about real life issues a lot of us face.

564,What do jolie and jk connect on? Not asking in a way that I don't think they do! I'm just kinda craving some cy,"good question! actually planning to write a chapter that focuses on their relationship (and perhaps show the return of strict dad JK) but in the series so far, ik they like watching shitty teen dramas together 😂 and they kind of connect by fighting with each other so much. I think they fight more than anyone else in the family bc they're the ones whose personality traits overlap the most. they're both protective, ambitious, fiery, and love to argue, so despite their differences (she's more extroverted, he's more emotional) they're actually really similar. from personal experience I have two family members like this and they SWEAR they're totally different. 



It's also really interesting writing a family where the parents aren't slotted into gender roles, because I feel like JK and Jolie's bickering is almost mother/daughter, but at the same time, he would 1000% have that protective dad mindset that's like 'hands off my daughter, I've got a lacrosse stick and I'm not afraid to use it.' Going even deeper, which you didn't ask for but oh well, I feel like JK having his first kid hero-worship him made him a little unprepared for Jolie, who very clearly doesn't. kinda like Tae has to deal with Ji-tae being embarrassed of him/wanting to grow up, I feel like JK has to deal with connecting in ways that aren't just sharing the same interests. I feel like when they do connect it's really nice, and I think in the same way Ji goes to Tae for the tough emotional stuff, I think Jolie would probably go to Jungkook more as she got older. I'm thinking there's probably a moment later in life where she finally gets that she's actually really similar to him; she'd totally have one of those situations where it's like after people have kids and then they understand why their parents acted the way they did. I could go on forever about their dynamic lol, same with Tae and Ji, it's all so complex and interesting 🤔","19 Feb, 2022",{'cy'},1264563486,

My original plot was to have Tae work at the perfume counter, and JK was a rich CEO who came in every week to buy perfume for his mom. but then I wanted to make it more original, so I switched it to JK working there, and that's where I came up with his whole backstory, as to why he'd be there. and then that actually helped me write Tae's character a little more dynamically, bc he's the one who's mysterious at first. IBSY just came naturally because it's physically impossible for me to leave my characters alone 😂 but more seriously since I'd mentioned Jungkook's family drama with his mom in the first one, I felt like it had enough grounds to follow up on in a sequel. plus I really wanted to write them getting married 🥺","01 Feb, 2022",{'noy'},1262136743,

I got rejected from the business program at my dream school when I applied and it SUCKED. but as they say, where one door closes, a window opens! fr that sucks though especially because the college application process is really crazy and super unpredictable. there's so many factors going into those decisions that even if you're a perfect candidate (as I suspect you were 😏) it's not a guarantee. but they call it the application process because it is, in fact, a process! so don't feel too down on yourself about a rejection; there's so many more opportunities, and even if this was a top pick for you, take it from someone who already did the whole college thing, you could go to Harvard or to your local community college, and you'll most likely get the same education. what really matters is what YOU put into it, because you're the one who gets to shape your experience. so even if you're feeling embarrassed and upset now (which, totally valid, it's your party so cry if you want to, as long as you want to) don't get too down on yourself in the long run. even if you end up somewhere you don't expect, that's just a chance for you to knock it out of the park in ways you haven't imagined for yourself yet. but while you're in your feels hopefully my writing can continue to help!

466,Hello! I am one of your recent readers and I really enjoy reading your works! I want to start reading CY but the whole word count in honestly daunting😅 can you... advice me? :P,"Yes! Agreed it’s a lot of words 😂 but it’s really half the word count you see on ao3. Parts 1-5 are the story, and then Part 6 is those same chapters, just put in a linear timeline bc some readers wanted that version to reread. So you can subtract about 300k 👌🏼 and then part 7 is just more bonus chapters. So my advice is to start with book 1 and read from there. That way if you get to book 6 and don’t want to reread the same stuff you can skip right over it. Happy reading 🥰","27 Jan, 2022",{'cy'},1261565384,

444,"Is it difficult writing new Calendar Year chapters? Since the timeline is all over the place I'd imagine you have to be quite diligent with the details to make sure things don't contradict each other. I feel like if you offhandedly mention something in a chapter from their early years, you kind of have to carry that through the years. And similarity, it's probably hard to add a new detail in a chapter from their later years because it's almost like ""why hasn't that been mentioned before?"" Idk I just think that whole series is insane (in a very good way) and probably very hard to write, so major kudos to you, it's amazing <333","it's not too difficult, no. if I know something's happening within a certain time period I'll typically skim through the chapters that happen around it just to refamiliarize myself. also ctrl f is my best friend in my word doc usually that helps me find something I want to. and I think for details in terms of carrying them over, it's really just more character development that I can use/are great reference points for me to look back on if I'm writing them from an earlier time in their lives. as for mentioning something new, I think I really benefit from having each chapter happen in its own little pocket, where something begins and ends in the same chapter. so I can usually get away with adding something because it's like 'oh well this didn't come up because it wasn't relevant until this situation that we as readers didn't see until right now.' (for instance, Tae's whole fear of flying). normally when I retcon something in, I either try to explain why it wasn't mentioned until then/give it more backstory from a time we haven't explored so it feels more authentic. and then the other thing I try to do is make it make sense for the character/flow with what we know of their personality. so Tae's flying anxiety, for example, kind of tracks with his fear of driving. super long answer but I hope that explained it all lol!","23 Jan, 2022",{'cy'},1261023759,

I remember someone a while ago saying that they were able to guess your winter fest fic because of the ""kinda gross humany"" elements that you don't shy away from including, and I totally agree but also, the way that you write ""confession scenes"" (for lack of a better term lol) is very distinct. In IYLM in the closet, and in skillshare and CY in quiet kitchens, the scenes are just so sweet and vulnerable and so so beautiful cause idk tk get so shy and rambly and its kinda awkward but in the lovliest way. They're very unique and soft and I adore them, and that part at the end of skillshare was specifically what made me think ""oh yeah this is def kicksomeacid"" when i read it for the first time haha just thought i'd share. Love your writing <333","I’m glad it’s back too! And this was the loveliest comment!

I think for ones that I’ve written about already though, I try to look at them from new perspectives bc I try to write each one of my JKs and Taes from a new perspective. Off the top of my head an example is like CY Tae is super sensitive with body image whereas Leave a Memory Tae associates food with good/happy things.

305,How do you do it? Write and plan your stories out? Continue feeling motivated to write? You inspire me to write.,"Hmm. Good question. I don’t think I’m a very good model to work off of, bc usually I don’t outline anything 👀 I just go chapter by chapter and see where the plot takes me. Obviously it’s different for every writer but I’d say in terms of motivation what keeps me going is that it’s fun! Obviously positive feedback and hearing from people who engage with my works is really motivating too, but I think at the core of it all I’m having fun. For me writing is something I do to relax and express creativity, so whenever I feel myself hitting that point of more work than play I take a break. I think the best way to continue feeling motivated to write is to figure out what’s driving you in the first place, and if that’s starting to get tiring just take a step back and a deep breath, and remind yourself why you like doing this. I think another thing that helps me is not forcing myself to write in order. Sometimes I’ll want to write a scene that’s 4 chapters ahead of what I’m supposed to write for my next update, but I do it anyway! Same goes for switching between works; if you’re feeling inspired to write it right now, do it! It’ll help you so much when you aren’t feeling it later. This is kind of a long rambling answer but I hope this helps! And I’d love to read your writing if you ever want to share it, it’s so lovely to hear I’ve inspired a fellow writer!

I love the way you said my fics are about nothing particularly interesting I totally agree! And I agree about it making characters more relatable.

Because like, thats the first time he has burst and it all came pouring out. But I think tae forgave him too early😭 jk said some pretty bad things HOW COULD HE FORGIVE HIM SO QUICKLYY slksskks what are your thoughts on it?","Ok I’m glad you asked this bc I have many thoughts!! You’re also not the first person to think Tae was too quick to forgive him and I also agree! But I think characterwise this Tae is super super nice, and that can be to a fault. Obviously it benefits JK but whether or not he really deserves it…I think with this Tae he just wants everything to run smoothly/hates conflict and so he’ll sacrifice negative feelings on his part so everything can be normal again. I feel like with that situation I wanted to stay true to what Tae would do as a character even if I didn’t agree with it, and I think it shows how being nice can sometimes be a flaw. Like he’s opening himself up to the possibility of more hurt bc he gives people lots of chances to keep doing it (even JK). Ik a lot of readers also thought he forgave too quick and I agree but I think it’s in character, whether he should’ve done it or not","27 Nov, 2021",set(),1253853952,

Long answer, I definitely agree life is tough, and I think it’s normal for people to have periods of doubt or wonder if somethings changing. But I also believe people can find that forever kind of love even if it’s really rare. And I feel like for this taekook that’s what they have. So even when seasons change they don’t fall out of love bc they choose to lean on each other instead. So when those rough times come they actually grow closer, and I think because of that they never have those doubts.

Then everything just grew from there and I really wrote books 3-5 bc people got so attached to it and I feel like it really became a community thing. In terms of style with the month by month chapters, I had originally done that in book 1 bc I really didn’t have a plot figured out (I never do, I like to work through it as I go), so I wanted to give myself a set number of chapters to work within.

231,what's the best uni advice you can give?,"Ooooo okay

If you’re just starting: don’t worry about making friends! Ik it sounds kind of weird but if you’re stressed about not having a set group of friends already you shouldn’t be. I think esp with college it’s a time to really explore who you are and meet new people, so don’t expect to make instant connections (tho it’s great if you do). Also, you don’t have to have the same friends the whole way through! It’s a time of growth so if you don’t end up best friends for life with your freshman year roommate or the kids from your orientation group it’s totally fine. I always tell that to people starting college bc sometimes it takes a little while for us to find where we fit, and that’s totally ok.



If you’re in college already tho, I’d say to really make the most of your free time. You get a lot of it (comparably) and this is really the only time like it in your life. Sometimes it’s nice to just sit in your room and take a break but always be open to new opportunities! Some of my best college memories were going to ihop at midnight for no reason at all 😂



Coming from someone whose college experience got cut short by covid, definitely take those little moments of downtime and spend them with people! School’s obviously important and there’s a balance, but the college experience isn’t something to forget either ❤️❤️","13 Nov, 2021",set(),1251334909,

bc the truth is society needs all kinds of professions to function properly. it can't last long with only doctors, lawyers and businessmen. but money doesn't grow on trees, does it :/ so sacrifices are made and people do what's expected of them, keep existing instead of living

I’m lucky enough that I like doing something that earns money, but as a creative person it makes me so sad that art and passion is so underutilized esp when it come to choosing a career path.

I’ll slot in the most recent chapters after they’re finished, but that’s why I typically recommend people read the books in order, and then if they want to read the story chronologically afterwards to read the compilation. (I also recommend this bc even though the story is out of order time wise, the information you get isn’t. ie, the first chapter we meet the kids you get information about them you don’t have when we jump back to seeing them as babies, so it might be confusing if you didn’t know the other stuff before.)

Also fine if it’s in a more plot heavy fic but I find myself appreciating it more (probably the wrong word) only if it serves to further the plot/gives us more insights into the characters. I think smut for the sake of smut (in a fic that isn’t explicitly written to be that) can come across as forced/cheap. For CY specifically, so much of the feedback I’ve gotten has been that people read it to relax or put themselves in a good headspace (not that you can’t do those with smut) but I think adding a sex scene wouldn’t really fit the theme I’ve built. At this point I think I may write a sex scene for If you love me, but only bc I think it would work as an extension of the plot, not a distraction from it.","15 Oct, 2021","{'iylm', 'cy'}",1245665547,

- which is your favourite chapter? honestly mine’s the one where jungkook’s crying over taehyung dying of high cholesterol and when jungkook came home from london crying i love crybaby koo

- which chapter was the hardest to write?

- which chapter do you relate to the most?

- and how the hell do you write so fast","- this is so tough for me. Top 3 I would say are June in book 1 with the vodka and the chips, the one where Jungkook becomes Appa, and the beach proposal. Oh and also the most recent December one with the sexy anime cosplay. Ugh I love so many of them but those are my top tier I think

- hardest to write was the wedding/the reception. I’m always nervous about writing conventional things bc I don’t want it to come off as tacky or trite so making those feel authentic was really a struggle for me. But I’m happy with how they turned out!

- chapter I relate to the most is probably the yoga chapter. I love it now but I hated it so much at first

I wouldn’t want to set a fic in Korea and have it be incorrect (not the word I wanted to use but I can’t think of it rn).

Honestly it's just a melting pot over here, some stuff that's super popular I have no idea about, and other things I'm like a superfan. Best rule of thumb is to just ask me!



As for writing for other fandoms, yes! My first fic was actually for Cowboy Bebop, and once I finish these two most recent taekook fics I'm going to write a follow up to a one-shot I did for MDZS (the Untamed). Totally open to writing for other stuff, it's really just about when and where the inspiration strikes.



I will say (and you didn't ask but whatever), I do like writing taekook a lot bc they're my OCs (obvi bc the real ones are real living people), so I get to play with the characterization a lot. I think writing for established fictional characters is a little more constricting bc I want to stay true to that depiction of them, if that makes sense. Not that it's a bad thing!

Basically I wanted to write a JK CEO fic, and the original plot was that Tae was the one to work at the perfume counter (with Jimin), and JK was this rich guy that came in to by perfume every week. And Tae thinks it’s for each new gf he has but in reality it’s for his blind mom who likes having something new to smell/keeps her company while JK’s at work.



Obviously the fic is waaay different now, bc when I was thinking about it I wanted to divert expectations a little with the premise, so I switched it to JK working there instead. And then that’s where his whole storyline came from, bc I needed a reason for him to work there in the first place. Tae in the fic is pretty similar to how I’d originally imagined him, but I think in the fic he’s in a more powerful position (bc he has more information) than JK which makes his dynamic interesting.
